[[2312.10033\] Earliest Galaxies in the JADES Origins Field: Luminosity Function and Cosmic Star-Formation Rate Density 300 Myr after the Big Bang (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10033)

**Aims:** The study presents the earliest galaxy population in the JADES Origins Field (JOF), the deepest imaging field observed with JWST.

**Methods**: 

- **Data** The study used the ancillary HST data and novel JWST data to search the high-z galaxies. The wavelength coverage of HST images and JWST images span in the range of 0.4-0.9 micron and 0.8-5 micron, respectively. They combine all the imaging data at >2 micron to construct the deepest imaging, reaching as deep as ~ 31.4 AB mag in the stack and ~ 30.1-30.8 AB mag in the individual images.
- **Methods** The study develop a forward modeling method to infer the properties of the evolving LF without binning in redshift or luminosity that marginalizes over the phot-z uncertainty of the candidate galaxies and incorporates the impact of non-detections.

**Results**: 

- **Galaxy Selection** The authors measure the phot-z and use a robust selection criteria to identify a sample of eight galaxy candidates at z=11.5-15 and they do not have any positive detection in the redshift range of 15<z<20.
- **The evolution of LF** They find a z=12 luminosity in good agreement with prior results, and that the luminosity function normalization and UV luminosity density decline by a factor of âˆ¼2.5 from z=12 to z=14.
