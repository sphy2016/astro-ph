[[2304.14469\] The galaxy UV luminosity function at $\mathbf{z \simeq 11}$ from a suite of public JWST ERS, ERO and Cycle-1 programs (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14469)

- Tags: #JWST

- The study used the public available JWST data to search the high-z galaxies($z>9.5$), and they identify a sample of 61 robust candidates detected at $>=8$.
- Use this sample, the author determined the luminosity function over a luminosity range corresponding to four magnitudes. They found that the LF at this redshift range is best-fitted to a double pow law function. Meanwhile, they did not found that the significance evolution at bright end and a steep faint end, which is consistent with the results of previous studies.
- This lack of evolution suggests that we are entering a regime where mass quenching efficiency is lower or that there is reduced dust attenuation
- By integrating the LF, the authors arrive the luminosity density and hence star-formation rate density. The results support a continued smoothly declining $\rho_{SFR}$ at least $z=12$ and lies above both the rapidly declining  $\rho_{SFR}$ suggested by pre-JWST study and the constant star-formation efficiency model.

- Programs: UNCOVER, GLASS
- The authors used the NIRCam and NIRISS imaging in 7 bands over 45 arcmin^2 to identify 16 candidates at $9<z<12$ and 3 candidates $12<z<13$. The way that they used is selecting the drop-outs firstly and then used the SED fitting to derive the photometric redshift.
- Using the SED fitting, the authors studied the stellar mass, star-forming activity, the UV and optical band of these galaxies. They found that: (1) These galaxies have a wide range luminosity, young age, low-mass, and **low** star forming activity (This point agrees the previous studies.); (2) Some galaxies appear to show Balmer break; (3) The UV slopes of these galaxies are typical for galaxies at $z>9$ but not as extreme as bluest recently discovered sources.
- They also found a rapid evolution of mass function of galaxies and an evolution of the UV slope with redshift. More deep imaging data and spectroscopic data are required to constrain the evolution of these function and the physical properties of these galaxies.

[[2305.03042\] JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy of the triply-lensed $z = 10.17$ galaxy MACS0647$-$JD (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03042)

- The authors used the NIRSpec MAS prism data to reveal a tripe-lensed galaxies candidate at $z \sim 11$ and the spectrum obtained shows the metal line and high-order Hydrogen line. Using these lines, the authors calculated the gas-metallicity, the ionization parameter, and the ionizing photons productions rate of this galaxy.
- The spectrum of this sources shows a softened Ly$\alpha$ break, which is an evidence of strong Ly$\alpha$ dumping wing. This means that the galaxy could not ionize the environment surrounding it. 
- The author also found that there are two components in this system. The stellar mass of whole galaxies are $\sim 10^{8}$ solar mass. Component A has a stellar mass $\sim 6 \times 10^6$ solar mass, with a star-forming rate of $2$ solar mass per year.  Component B are older than component A , more dusty, more smaller. This galaxy could be the merger system found by JWST at highest redshift to date. This sources is most distant merger to date.

[[2305.04662\] Efficient NIRCam Selection of Quiescent Galaxies at 3 < z < 6 in CEERS (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04662)

- The author develop an empirical method to select quiescent galaxies at $z>3$. The former way could miss up to 70% such galaxies at this redshift. 
- There are two problems of current selection method: (1) The former way selects these galaxies at UVJ color diagram, the rest-frame J band is redshift to above 5 mirco. The spritzer and JWST MIRI could cover this wavelength. However, the data taken from spritzer is not deep enough for this kind of studies, and the survey efficiency of JWST MIRI is not high enough.  (2) The quiescent galaxies are bluer than that at $z\lesssim 2$, due to their relatively young age. Therefore, the authors designed a color-color method based on JWST/NIRCam observation to select these galaxies.
- As a test, the author applied their method to the CEERS program, and filter >99% sources. They identify 44 candidate at $3<z<5$.

[[2305.04741\] RIOJA I. The core of the highest redshift galaxy overdensity at $z= 7.88$ confirmed by NIRSpec/JWST (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04741)

- The study report the confirmation of pro-cluster at $z \sim 7.88$. This photo-cluster are first selected as candidates using the WFC3 observation carried out by HFF program and the spziter data. Here the authors used the NIRSpec IFU data and identify 7 galaxies in this proton-cluster (4 galaxies in the core regions). Three member galaxies are tentatively detected in the ALMA band 6.
- The SED fitting shows that these galaxies have a wide range of stellar mass and star-forming activity
- The member galaxies are on the verge of merging in a few to several tens Myr to become a large galaxy with M∗ ∼ 6 × 109M. **The** presence of a multiple merger and evolved galaxies in the core region of A2744-z7p9OD indicates that environmental effects are already at work 650 Myr after the Big Bang.

[[2305.0704]Linking UV spectral properties of MUSE Ly-alpha emitters at z>3 to Lyman continuum escape](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07044)

- **Sample**: The authors used the Lyman alpha line properties (peak separation, FWHM, asymmetry) to separate the potential LyC emitters and non-LyC emitters. They selected these potential LyC emitters from a complied sample of 1442 MUSE-Wide and MUSE-HUDF LAE in the redshift range $2.9 < z < 6.7$
- **Properties**: They stacked the spectra of the LAEs and found that: 1) These galaxies shows strong nebular emission, indicating that high ionization parameters. 2) The equivalent width of HeII$\lambda$1640 is high, indicating that the ionization spectrum is hard. 3) Si II emissions shows that the presence of neutral hydrogen off the line of slight, thus implying a highly anisotropic interstellar medium. 4) The high line ratio (C IV/ CIII) partly associated with the increased ISM transparency.
- **Conclusion**:our results substantiate that the Civ/Ciii] ratio can be used as an indirect tracer of 𝑓esc, providing a promising tool for identification of ionising sources among star-forming galaxies in the epoch of reionisation. 

[[2305.07066]Mini-Quenching of High-Redshift Galaxies by Bursty Star Formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07066)

- **Methods**: The researchers used three different models of galaxy formation to study mini-quenching: the periodic box simulation IllustrisTNG, the zoom-in simulation VELA, and an empirical halo model. They examined the impact of various factors on mini-quenching, including stellar feedback, lack of gas accretion onto galaxies, and galaxy-galaxy interactions. They also analyzed star formation histories (SFHs) and created mock spectral energy distributions of mini-quenched galaxies.
- **Results and conclusions**: The study found that the abundance of mini-quenching events agrees across the three models. These events first appear below z ~ 8 and increase in frequency with cosmic time, from ~0.5% at z = 7 to ~1-2% at z = 4. The star formation rate duty cycle at z = 7 is found to be around 99.56%, consistent with the SFHs inferred for VELA galaxies. Mini-quenching at z = 4 - 8 is found to be short-lived, with a duration of ~20 - 40 Myr, close to the free-fall timescale of the inner halo. However, the mock spectral energy distributions of mini-quenched galaxies in the IllustrisTNG and VELA models do not match the photometry of the observed galaxy JADES-GS-z7-01-QU, unless their SFHs are artificially adjusted to be more bursty on timescales of ~40 Myr.

[[2305.09021] Fraction of Clumpy Star-Forming Galaxies at 0.5≤z≤3 in UVCANDELS: Dependence on Stellar Mass and Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09021)

- **Aims**: The purpose of this study is to examine the phenomenon of star-forming clumps within galaxies in the rest-frame UV spectrum. By studying these sub-structures, the researchers aim to gain insights into their formation and evolution, which can contribute valuable information to theoretical models of galaxy evolution.
- **Methods used**  The researchers devised a new method to identify star-forming clumps in high-resolution rest-frame UV images of galaxies. They used imaging data from the CANDELS and UVCANDELS projects, focusing on an HST/F160W≤ 25 AB mag sample of 6767 galaxies at 0.5 ≤ z ≤ 3 across four fields: GOODS-N, GOODS-S, EGS, and COSMOS. A low-pass band filter was applied in Fourier space to reconstruct the background image of a galaxy, which allowed for the detection of small-scale features (clumps) on the background-subtracted image. Clumpy galaxies were defined as those with at least one off-center clump accounting for a minimum of 10% of the galaxy's total rest-frame UV flux.
- **Results:** The findings suggest that the fraction of clumpy galaxies (fclumpy) increases with redshift, peaking at around 65% at z ∼ 1.5. It was also observed that fclumpy in low-mass galaxies (9.5 ≤ log(M∗/M) ≤ 10) is 10% higher than that of their high-mass counterparts (log(M∗/M) > 10.5). No significant correlation between fclumpy and the galaxy's environment was found within the redshift range of the study. 
- **Conclusion**: From these results, the authors concluded that the primary driving mechanism for clump formation is the fragmentation of gas clouds under violent disk instability, while common incidents in dense environments, such as mergers, do not appear to be the dominant processes.

[[2305.11225] Quasar Luminosity Function at z = 7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11225)

- **Aims**: The study aims to measure the quasar luminosity function (LF) at z=7, utilizing 35 spectroscopically confirmed quasars in the redshift range of 6.55<z<7.15. 

- **Methods used**: The researchers used a sample of 22 quasars from the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) project, along with 13 brighter quasars from existing literature. This allowed them to cover an unprecedentedly wide range of rest-frame ultraviolet magnitudes between -28<M1450<−23. They then used a maximum likelihood fit to a double power-law model to analyze the LF.

- **Results**: The study found that the binned LF significantly flattens toward the faint end populated by the SHELLQs quasars. The researchers found the LF shape to be remarkably similar from z=4 to 7, while the amplitude decreases substantially toward higher redshifts, hinting at an accelerating decline at z≥6. 

- **Conclusion**: The study concludes that the estimated ionizing photon density, 1048.2±0.1 s−1 Mpc−3, contributes to less than 1% of the critical rate necessary to keep the intergalactic medium ionized at z=7, implying that quasars are not a significant contributor to cosmic reionization.

[[2305.13405]Small Region, Big Impact: Highly Anisotropic Lyman-continuum Escape from a Compact Starburst Region with Extreme Physical Properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13405)

- **Aims**: The research focuses on the Sunburst Arc, a strongly lensed, LyC emitter at z=2.37, to elucidate the small-scale physics of LyC escape.
- **Methods used**: They analyze HST broadband and narrowband imaging to identify and study the properties of the LyC leaking region in the galaxy.
- **Results**: 
  1. The study reveals that the small (<100 pc) LyC leaking region exhibits extreme properties: a very blue UV slope, a high ionization state, strong oxygen emission, and a high Lyman-alpha escape fraction. These properties are not found in any non-leaking regions of the galaxy. 
  2. A comparison of the UV slope with starburst population models suggests that the leaking region's UV emission comprises nearly "pure" stellar light, with minimal contamination from surrounding nebular continuum emission and dust extinction. This implies a highly directional LyC escape, suggesting that stellar feedback from an ionizing star cluster may create an anisotropic "pencil beam" viewing geometry in the surrounding gas, facilitating unabsorbed LyC escape through perforated hole(s).

- **Conclusion**: 
  1. The study concludes that such anisotropic escape processes contribute to the significant scatters between galaxy properties and LyC escape fraction in observations, underlining the importance of sightline effects. 
  2. The findings indicate that strong lensing uniquely reveals the small-scale physics regulating galaxies' ionizing budget for reionization.

[[2305.13364]The ionizing photon production efficiency of bright z∼2-5 galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13364)

- **Aims**: The research aimed to understand the relationship between ionizing emission and physical properties of bright and massive sources. In particular, the research sought to examine how ξ∗ion varies with redshift and other physical properties of the galaxies.
- **Methods used**: The researchers used the BEAGLE code to conduct spectro-photometric fits that provided constraints on ξ∗ion and the physical parameters of the galaxies. They used multi-band photometry data from the VANDELS fields and the measurements of UV rest-frame emission lines (CIII]λ1909, HeIIλ1640, OIII]λ1666) obtained from deep VIMOS spectra.
- **Results**: 1) The researchers found no significant evolution of ξ∗ion with redshift within the probed range. They observed a slight increase in ionizing efficiency at fainter MUV and bluer UV slopes, but these trends were less noticeable when restricting the analysis to a complete subsample at log(Mstar/M⊙)>9.5. 2) They found a significant trend of increasing ξ∗ion with increasing EW(Lyα) and higher ionizing efficiency for high-EW CIII]λ1909 and OIII]λ1666 emitters. 3) Strong correlations were found with respect to stellar mass, specific star-formation rate (sSFR), and SFR surface density (ΣSFR). The relation between ξ∗ion and sSFR showed a monotonic increase, with a low scatter and little dependence on mass. Objects above the main-sequence of star-formation consistently had higher-than-average ξ∗ion. There was also a clear increase of ξ∗ion with ΣSFR.
- **Conclusion**: this research found that the production efficiency of ionizing photons in galaxies is related to various physical properties of the galaxies, such as their UV slope, stellar mass, specific star-formation rate, and SFR surface density.

[[2305.14418] Extremely red galaxies at z=5−9 with MIRI and NIRSpec: dusty galaxies or obscured AGNs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14418)

- **Aims**: The researchers found 37 EROs in the CEERS field with specific photometric attributes and redshifts between 5<z<7. These EROs are characterized by their distinct bimodal spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The study aims to understand the nature of these EROs and their implications for our understanding of the universe.
- **Methods used**: The researchers analyzed the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 8 of these EROs using MIRI and NIRSpec observations. These observations were then interpreted using stellar population models and AGN (Active Galactic Nucleus) templates. The analysis aimed to determine whether the EROs fit better as dusty galaxies or obscured AGNs, based on the models and templates.
- **Results**: 1) The research found that both a dusty galaxy model and an obscured AGN model provided similarly good fits for the EROs' SEDs. However, these models predicted different stellar properties: the dusty galaxy model suggests a massive and dusty ERO, while the obscured AGN model suggests a low mass and obscured ERO hosting an obscured quasar (QSO). 2) The SED modeling did not favor either scenario. However, the fact that all these EROs are unresolved, point-like sources in all NIRCam bands makes the AGN scenario more plausible.; 3) The presence of such EROs, if confirmed, could significantly alter our understanding of the universe. If any EROs are confirmed to have a mass log M/M_sun≳10.5, it would increase pre-JWST number densities at z>7 by up to a factor ∼60. Similarly, if they are obscured quasars with high luminosities, their number would far exceed that of bright blue quasars.
- **Conclusion**: In conclusion, the study presents an intriguing new population of extremely red objects with unique spectral energy distributions. Their true nature and the source of their red continuum emission remain to be determined, calling for additional mid-IR wavelength photometry research.

[[2305.15458] Detection of an X-ray quasar in a gravitationally-lensed z=10.3 galaxy suggests that early supermassive black holes originate from heavy seeds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15458)

#Tags: JWST & Chandra X-Ray

- **Aims**: The study aims to investigate the origins of the first black holes (BHs), which is a subject of ongoing scientific debate. Two theories for the seeds of the first BHs are suggested: light seeds, remnants of the first stars (10-100 M⊙), or heavy seeds, arising from the direct collapse of gas clouds (104-105 M⊙). To probe these origins, researchers seek to detect growing BHs at very early times in the Universe (z>10).
- **Methodology**: The researchers used data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the JWST (James Webb Space Telescope) to identify and observe a massive, X-ray-luminous black hole in a gravitationally-lensed galaxy located at a high redshift (z≈10.3) behind the Abell 2744 cluster lens. This combined use of Chandra and JWST observations provided the ability to measure the properties of the host galaxies of these early BHs.
- **Results**: The study reports the detection of a heavily-obscured quasar with a high bolometric luminosity, suggesting a massive black hole (MBH∼4×107 M⊙) assuming it is accreting at the Eddington limit. Notably, this BH mass is comparable to the inferred stellar mass of its host galaxy, which contradicts the typical relationship observed in the local Universe, where the BH mass is approximately 0.1% of the host galaxy's stellar mass.
- **Conclusion**: The existence of a black hole with such a high mass, and the large BH-to-galaxy stellar mass ratio, only ∼500 Myrs after the Big Bang, provides evidence in favor of the heavy seed theory for the origin of the first black holes. The findings align with theoretical predictions and suggest that such black holes likely originated from heavy seeds rather than the remnants of the first stars. 

[[2305.16141]Constraints on the Faint End of the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function at z ~ 4-8 from Deep JWST Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16141)

- **Aims**: The purpose of this research is to analyze a selection of 3300 galaxies between redshifts z~3.5 and z~8.5, selected from JWST images in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) and UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey field. it intends to compute the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) to understand how this evolves over time and with different mass ranges.
- **Methods used**:  a new method for estimating the Eddington bias, considering its potential dependence on both stellar mass and redshift, while also accounting for skewness in the error distribution, is introduced.
- **Results and conclusions**: The study, upon computing the resulting cosmic stellar mass density, finds a flatter evolution with redshift than previous studies have shown. 

[[2305.16670]Insight from JWST/NIRCam into galaxy overdensities around bright Lyα emitters during reionization: implications for ionized bubbles at z∼9](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16670)

- **Aims**: The goal of this research is to examine the possibility of large-scale galaxy overdensities associated with two very UV-bright Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) at z = 8.7 in the EGS field.
- **Methods used**: 
  - The study employs CEERS JWST/NIRCam imaging to investigate the research objective. A color selection technique was designed to identify objects within the range of z = 8.4 - 9.1, which resulted in the selection of 28 candidates. 
  - The study then models the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these objects, infers their luminosities and stellar masses, and assesses their ionizing efficiency and morphology.
  - Furthermore, the study examines the spatial distribution of these objects to infer potential ionized bubbles.

- **Results**:
  - Among the 28 objects selected (including EGSY8p7), all are found to be moderately faint with stellar masses around 107.5-8.8 M⊙. 
  - They are effective ionizing agents and generally have simple morphologies with compact star-forming components. 
  -  Thirteen out of 27 objects besides EGSY8p7 are found to lie within a 5 arcmin radius of EGSY8p7, which corresponds to a galaxy overdensity four times greater than the average at separations < 5 arcmin.

- **Conclusion**: The spatial distribution of the sample suggests the potential existence of a large ionized bubble (R >= 2 pMpc) that encompasses both LAEs in the field. This finding is theoretically unexpected, but could potentially be generated by a galaxy population four times denser than the average, given moderate escape fractions over extended periods. Future spectroscopic follow-ups could further ascertain the size of any ionized bubble and the properties of the galaxies contributing to its formation.
