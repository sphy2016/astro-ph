[[2310.20675\] NOEMA reveals the true nature of luminous red JWST z>10 galaxy candidates (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20675)

- **Aims:** The study present the results of observations of four galaxies selected as high-z redshift galaxy candidates using JWST data. The goal is to discriminate whether these galaxies are indeed at ultra-high redshifts or are lower redshift contaminants.
- **Methods:** The study focused on galaxies that were ‘red dropouts’ in the 1.5-2.0 μm range, initially identified as ultra-high-redshift galaxy candidates. Observations from JWST were complemented with ground-based millimeter-interferometry data from NOEMA Polyfix.
- **Results:** 
  - **Detection of Continuum Emissions:** The NOEMA observations detected >10σ continuum emissions in the far-infrared (FIR) range from the target galaxies, indicating a redshift of less than 5 (z<5).
  - **Modeling Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs):** The optical to FIR spectral energy distributions of the galaxies were modeled, suggesting that they are not ultra-high-redshift galaxies but rather massive, dust-obscured star-forming galaxies with redshifts between 2 and 4 (z∼2−4).
  - **Contribution to Cosmic Star-Formation Rate Density:** These galaxies contribute significantly to the cosmic star-formation rate density at a redshift of around 3.5.

- **Conclusions:** The combination of JWST and NOEMA observations helps in unveiling the true nature of the galaxies, refuting their initial classification as ultra-high-redshift galaxies. The study proposes a novel approach to select and identify intermediate to high-redshift dust-obscured galaxies. This opens a new window in studying obscured star-formation in such redshift ranges.

[[2311.00023\] High dust content of a quiescent galaxy at z~2 revealed by deep ALMA observation (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00023)

- **Aims** The study seeks to understand the presence of cold dust in a massive galaxy, G4, which appears quiescent and lies at a redshift of z∼2. The goal is to probe the galaxy's passive evolution and dust depletion over time.
- **Methods** The research involves deep ALMA observations that detected a 2 mm continuum source and utilized multi-band photometry to estimate the redshift and specific star-formation rate (sSFR) of G4. The study also involves a compilation and analysis of literature on z≳1 quiescent galaxies.
- **Results** G4 is identified as a dust-rich, quiescent galaxy that is unusually dust-rich for its age and mass, with an estimated mass-weighted age of 1-2 Gyr. It falls significantly below the main sequence (MS) at z=2. The study compares G4’s age and dust-to-stellar mass ratio with other quiescent galaxies from the literature.
- **Conclusions** The findings suggest that G4 may have undergone a unique evolutionary path, with a prolonged period of dust retention and morphological features that indicate a less efficient form of star-formation quenching. This could imply that mechanisms such as morphological quenching or inefficient feedback have played a role in its history. The high dust yield hints at the possibility of dust survival, grain growth, or recent accretion events. Further observations are needed to fully grasp the implications for galaxy evolution theories and the process of quenching in the early universe.

[[2311.00771\] ALMA 400pc Imaging of a z=6.5 Massive Warped Disk Galaxy (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00771)

- **Aims** The study aims to characterize the physical properties of the host galaxy of a quasar at redshift z=6.5406 using high-resolution observations to understand the galaxy's dynamics and the interaction of its disk with the surrounding halo gas.
- **Methods** The authors used ALMA to observe the [CII] line and dust continuum emissions at 0.075" resolution and archival MUSE data for Ly-alpha observations. They performed modeling to understand the warp in the disk and analyzed the dynamics within the galaxy.
- **Results** 
  - **Disk** The emission from the host galaxy indicates a thin, rotating disk with a radius of 1.1 kpc and a consistent velocity dispersion, leading to a calculated scale height. A warp in the disk is identified by the [CII] velocity field and yields an inclination estimate of 40.4+-1.3 degrees and a rotational velocity of 116+-3 km/s. The dynamical mass estimate of the galaxy is lower than expected from local scaling relations., with an excess of dust emission suggesting a gravitationally unstable star-forming region. 
  - **Gas**  Using archival MUSE Ly-alpha observations, we argue that counter-rotating halo gas could provide the torque needed to warp the disk. We further detect a region with excess (15-sigma) dust continuum emission, which is located 1.3 kpc northwest of the galaxy's center and is gravitationally unstable (Toomre-Q < 0.04). We posit this is a star-forming region whose formation was triggered by the warp, because the region is located within a part of the warped disk where gas can efficiently lose angular momentum. 

- **Conclusions** The research highlights how gas interactions at the disk-halo boundary can impact the development of massive galaxies in the universe's early epochs.

 [[2311.01128\] Sub-mJy radio emission from high-redshift active galactic nuclei in the footprint of the VLA Sky Survey (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01128)

- **Aims of the Study:**

  - To investigate the collective radio emission of a sample of about 3700 radio-non-detected AGNs at redshift z≥4.

  - To understand the typical radio power and spectral properties of these high-redshift AGNs.

- **Methods**
  - The study used a technique called "image stacking" on "Quick Look" images from the first two epochs of the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS) centered on the AGNs' positions.
  - The stacking analysis was conducted at 3 GHz to detect sub-mJy emission levels.
  - The sample was cross-matched with the FIRST survey for spectral analysis, and with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer for mid-infrared color analysis.

- **Results:**

  - The study found that AGN-related radio emission is common in the sample, with characteristic radio powers ranging from Pchar=(2−13)×10^24 W Hz^-1.

  - Signal-to-noise ratios of the stacked maps fell between 4-6, with expectations that future data could improve detection limits.

  - A characteristic spectral index of α∗=−0.30±0.15 was identified for the faint radio emission from these AGNs, consistent with detected AGNs from the same redshift range.

- **Conclusion:**

  - The study concludes that radio emission associated with AGNs is prevalent even in those not individually detected at radio frequencies.

  - There's potential for more refined analysis with the completion of the third epoch of VLASS observations.

  - The infrared data supports the idea that AGNs significantly contribute to the radio emission in the sub-mJy regime for high-redshift sources.

[[2311.01158\] Characterisation of Herschel-selected strong lens candidates through HST and sub-mm/mm observations (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01158)

- **Aims** 
  - To identify and confirm strongly lensed galaxies from a set of candidates detected by Herschel.
  - To model and understand the properties of these systems, particularly in the near-infrared (near-IR) spectrum.

- **Methods** 
  - The researchers conducted HST snapshot observations at 1.1 μm for 281 candidate lensed galaxies with significant 500μm flux densities.
  - They performed surface brightness distribution modeling and subtraction to identify foreground lensing candidates.
  - A combination of visual inspection and high-resolution archival data was used to classify systems by lensing likelihood.

- **Results**
  - From the 281 candidates, 65 systems were confirmed as lensed, with 30 being new discoveries.
  - For 23 systems, they conducted successful lens modeling and source reconstruction using singular isothermal ellipsoid models.
  - The findings regarding Einstein radii and source magnifications align with previous studies, but the circularized radii of background sources are smaller compared to measurements in sub-mm/mm wavelengths.

- **Conclusions**
  - The study expanded the understanding of lensed systems by identifying new ones and by providing a comparison with previous surveys such as SLACS.
  - It highlighted the efficiency of lens-independent selection methods in identifying faint and diffuse galaxy lenses and group lenses.
  - This work sets the stage for further characterization of the near-IR properties and stellar masses of these lensed dusty star-forming galaxies.

[[2311.01658\] The AGN fraction in high-redshift protocluster candidates selected by Planck and Herschel (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01658)

- **Aims:**  The research is aimed at understanding how the growth of galaxies and their supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is influenced by the early development of galaxy clusters, known as protoclusters (PCs).
- **Methods:** The study utilizes a sample of about 228 red and compact Planck-selected protocluster candidates detected by Herschel/SPIRE. Mid-infrared photometry from the WISE/AllWISE database for approximately 650 high-redshift galaxy counterparts is analyzed. A machine learning clustering algorithm, along with WISE color cuts, is applied to differentiate AGNs from other sources.
- **Results:** The researchers found that the AGN fraction in protocluster candidates is approximately 11.3% with a margin of error, slightly higher than the 9.5% observed in field galaxies. For a subset of 'red' SPIRE sources indicative of denser areas, the AGN fraction is higher, around 18.6%, compared to only 3.7% for 'non-red' sources.
- **Conclusions:** The findings suggest a significant environmental effect on the growth of SMBHs, with a higher incidence of AGN activity within the dense environments of protoclusters compared to the field, aligning with outcomes from other studies.

[[2311.01799\] J1046+4047: an extremely low-metallicity dwarf star-forming galaxy with O32 = 57 (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01799)

**Aims:** The study present the observations of one of the most metal-poor dwarf galaxies in the local Universe.

**Methods:** The galaxy at z=0.04874 was selected from the DR16 of the SDSS. The authors carry out a follow-up observation using the KOSMOS mounted on the APO 3.5 telescope.

**Results:** 

- **Low metallicity** The oxygen abundance 12 + log(O/H) = 7.082±0.016 in J1046+4047 is among the lowest ever observed.
- **High sSFR** The very high EW(H-beta) and very low M*/Lg indicate that the J1046+4047 emission is strongly dominated by a very young stellar population with an age < 2 Myr. Furthremore, J1046+4047 has a very high specific star-formation rate sSFR ∼ 430 Gyr−1 , indicating very active ongoing star formation.
- **Improving the Oxygen abundance calibrations** The galaxy exhibit very high O32 ratio. Using the extremely high O32, they have confirmed and improved the strong-line calibration for the determination of oxygen abundances in the most metal-deficient galaxies in the range < 7.65, and suitable for all galaxies with O32 < 60.
- **Enhanced H-alpha emissions** They find the Hα emission line in J1046+4047 to be enhanced by some non-recombination processes and thus can not be used for the determination of interstellar extinction.

[[2311.02015\] Extremely strong CIV 1550 nebular emission in the extremely low-metallicity star-forming galaxy J2229+2725 (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02015)

- **Aims:** The paper present the results of the HST/COS observations of J2229+2725, which is one of most metal-poor dwarf star-forming galaxies in the local Universe.
- **Methods:** The galaxy possesses extraordinary properties, as derived from earlier optical observations. In particular, it's characterized by a very low oxygen abundance 12+log(O/H) = 7.085, an extremely high O32 ratios of 53m and an extremely high EW(H-beta) = 577A.
- **Results:** They find an extremely strong nebular Civ1550 doublet in emission with EW of 43, which is several times higher than in other low-z star-forming galaxies. The ionizing radiation in J2229+2725 to be stellar origin and the high EW to be due to both extreme ionization conditions and a high carbon abundance.
- **Conclusions:** Because of its very low metallicity and stellar mass and exceptionally high star-formation activity, J2229+2725 is likely among the best local analogues of star-forming dwarf galaxies in the early universe.

[[2311.02866\] Quantifying the tension between cosmological models and JWST red candidate massive galaxies (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02866)

- **Aims** The study aims to evaluate the consistency of the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model with the observed abundance of massive galaxies at high redshifts.
- **Methods** The researchers developed a Python tool that uses the extended Press-Schechter model to calculate the distribution of dark matter halos. The tool is designed for quick computations to assess cosmological models against observational data.
- **Results** The tool demonstrated that the ΛCDM model could match the observed galaxy counts if star formation efficiency was around 30% at high redshifts. However, for lower efficiencies (~10%), the ΛCDM model appeared to be inconsistent with the data at a confidence level of about 2-3 sigma.

[[2311.02526\] Galaxy quenching at the high redshift frontier: A fundamental test of cosmological models in the early universe with JWST-CEERS (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02526)

- **Aims** The study aims to examine the size-mass relation of SFGs and the morphology-quenching relation at stellar mass M>10^9.5, over the redshift range 0.5<z<5.5.
- **Methods** The study utilizes deep imaging data from the JWST CEERS early release survey and HST CANDELS imaging. It analyses a sample of 2,450 galaxies, classifying them as either star-forming or quiescent, and examining their morphology through Sérsic profiles. The classifications are based on the UVJ color selection. The SFR measurements are based on SED fits.
- **Results** The results confirm that star-forming and quiescent galaxies display distinct morphologies, with different typical Sérsic indices, up to a redshift of 5.5. 
  - **SFGs** the size-mass relation slope remains nearly constant across redshifts but shows a slight increase around z∼4.2. The rate at which the intercept of this relation declines is consistent with past findings, and the intrinsic scatter within the relation remains relatively stable up to z=5.5.

- **Conclusions** The study concludes that the differences in morphology between star-forming and quiescent galaxies persist to higher redshifts than previously known, and the size-mass relation for star-forming galaxies has a nearly constant slope but a declining intercept with increasing redshift. 

[[2311.02526\] Galaxy quenching at the high redshift frontier: A fundamental test of cosmological models in the early universe with JWST-CEERS (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02526)

- **Aims** The study presents an analysis of the quenching of star-formation in the early Universe.  It seeks to pinpoint the factors that influence this quenching process.
- **Methods** The study employs a variety of advanced statistical methods, including Random Forest classification, area statistics, and partial correlation analysis, applied to data from the JWST-CEERS survey. It also compares observational data with predictions from the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE cosmological simulations.
- **Results**
  - Based on the simulations of (TNG and EAGLE), the quenching should be regulated by **supermassive black hole mass** in the early Universe.  However, the photometric observations could not put direct constrain on black hole mass.  Furthermore, both simulations identify the **stellar potential (ϕ∗)** as the optimal proxy for black hole mass in photometric data. The prediction made by simulations is consistent with the JWST-CEERS results. The stellar potential outperforms stellar mass, galaxy size, alaxy density, and Sérsic index as a predictor of quiescence at all epochs probed in JWST-CEERS.
  - The analysis concludes that a stable quenching mechanism likely tied to the central gravitational potential of galaxies has operated throughout the Universe's history. This mechanism is consistent with cosmological models where massive black holes, residing in deep potential wells, quench star formation via both ejective and preventative feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN).

- **Conclusions** The study uses two state-of-art simulations to identify the measurable predictions and combined it with JWST-CEERS results. They find the results implies a stable quenching mechanism operating throughout cosmic history, which is closely connected to the central gravitational potential in galaxies. This connection is explained in cosmological models via massive black holes forming and growing in deep potential wells, and subsequently quenching galaxies through a mix of ejective and preventative active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback.

[[2311.02158\] MOSEL survey: JWST reveals major mergers/strong interactions drive the extreme emission lines in the early universe (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02158)

- **Aims** The research aims to explore the characteristics of galaxies located near extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) at redshift z~3, using JWST's NIRCam images from the JADES survey. The focus is to understand the potential merging activity of EELGs.
- **Methods** By employing deep NIRCam imaging and comparing data with simulations (TNG100), the study examines the projected proximity and velocity differences of companion galaxies to EELGs and analyzes their mass ratios.
- **Results** The study finds that EELGs are likely to have more massive companions compared to a control group, with mass ratios more than ten times higher. This holds true even when compared to a control sample matched for stellar mass and specific star formation rate (SFR).
- **Conclusions** EELGs are often in the process of strong interactions or major mergers, which is consistent regardless of their stellar mass or specific SFR. The researchers propose that such interactions or mergers may stimulate the conditions that lead to the extreme emission lines observed in EELGs, and that this increased rate of merging may explain why EELGs are more prevalent at higher redshifts (z>6).

[[2311.04019\] The robustness in identifying and quantifying high-redshift bars using JWST observations (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04019)

- **Aims** Assessing the reliability of identifying and quantifying galactic bars in high-redshift galaxies with JWST and establishing a method to correct for measurement inaccuracies caused by observational conditions.
- **Methods** 
  1. The study used a sample of nearby spiral galaxies to create simulated images mimicking the conditions of the JWST's CEERS survey.
  2. The researchers compared measurements of galactic bars before and after degrading the images to resemble the survey's resolution and noise level.
  3. Correction functions were derived to adjust for the underestimation of bar size and ellipticity caused by resolution effects.

- **Results** 
  - The bar position angle measurement is unaffected by resolution, both the bar size  and bar ellipticity are typically underestimated.
  - The detection of bars is reliable when the ratio of bar size to the FWHM of PSF is above 2, but the detection rate drops significantly when this ratio is lower.
  - Simulations show that the apparent fraction of galaxies with bars (fbar) observed in the F444W band of JWST decreases with increasing redshift, which matches observations from Conte et al.

- **Conclusions** The study concludes that the observed decrease in the galactic bar fraction with increasing redshift is likely due to observational effects rather than an actual evolution in the bar fraction. Furthermore, it's necessary to consider resolution effects and intrinsic growth in bar size to accurately interpret the evolution of galactic bars in the early universe.

[[2311.04279\] The Complete CEERS Early Universe Galaxy Sample: A Surprisingly Slow Evolution of the Space Density of Bright Galaxies at z ~ 8.5-14.5 (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04279)

- **Aims** The paper present a sample of 88 high-z galaxy candidates at z~8.5-14.5 to confirm the early JWST conclusions that bright galaxy in this epoch are more abundant than predicted by most theoretical models.
- **Methods** The authors construct a sample containing 88 galaxy candidates. These candidates are selected from CEERS field based on six broad-band and one medium band JWST images. Using this sample, they construct the UVLF at z~9, 11, 14.
- **Results** The bright end of UVLF only changes modestly from z~14 to z~9, compared to a steeper increase from z~8 to z~4. Although these UVLF are based on photometrically-selected sample, but follow-up spec observations confirm 13 out of them with only one significant contaminant.
- **Conclusions** The slowed evolution of bright end of UVLF require the changes to the dominant physical processes regulating star formation. The observed results agree with the models which naturally have enhanced star-formation efficiency and/or stochasticity. Based on this, they conclude that significant variations of dust attenuation with redshift are unlikely to be the dominant factor at these high redshifts.  An evolving stellar initial mass function could also bring model predictions into better agreement with their results. 

[[2311.04270\] Identification of High-Redshift Galaxy Overdensities in GOODS-N and GOODS-S (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04270)

- **Aims** The authors conduct a systematic search for high-z galaxy overdensities at 4.9<z~Spec~<8.9 in GOODS-S and GOODS-N.
- **Methods** Based on the images from JADES and JEMS programs and the HST, they select high-z galaxies. These galaxies are confirmed using JWST/FRESCO spectroscopy over $\lambda = 3.9 \mu m - 5.0 \mu m$ through identification of either Hα or [OIII]λ5008 around the best-fit photometric redshift. They rest-UV magnitudes and continuum slope of these galaxies are derived from photometry.
- **Results**:
  - They find 17 significant galaxy overdensity across both field (7 in GOODS-N and 10 in GOODS-S)
  - By comparing the galaxies in the overdensities and in the field, they find that the brightest and reddest objects appear in more dense environments and thus are surrounded by more galaxy neighbors than their fainter and bluer counterparts, suggesting accelerated galaxy evolution within overdense environments. including the two highest redshift spectroscopically confirmed galaxy overdensities to date at ⟨zspec⟩=7.955 and ⟨zspec⟩=8.222 (representing densities around ∼6 and ∼12 times that of a random volume).
  - The total mass is estimated via stellar mass to halo mass relations, whose value is  11.5≤log10(Mhalo/M⊙)≤13.4. These protocluster candidates are expected to evolve into massive galaxy clusters by z=0.

- **Aims** The authors present a measurements of slope for a sample of 36 faint galaxies at z~9-16, which is  discovered in NGDeep.
- **Methods** Based on a robust photometric measurements for UV-faint galaxies, they measure UV slopes via power-law fitting and via SED fitting. The SED fitting software used in this study is BAGPIPE.
- **Results**
  - **UV slope** The median value for slope from power-law fitting is -2.7 and that from SED-fitting is -2.3 for full sample. They also find when only 2-3 photometric detection available, SED-fitting has a lower scatter and reduced biases than photometric power-law fitting. After correction, the median value is -2.5 for SED fitting.
  - **Stellar properties** Based on SED fits, they find their sample is low mass, fairly dust-poor, and modestly young with median SFR of log(SFR) = -0.3 Msol/yr.

- **Conclusions** 
  - They We find no strong evidence for ultra-blue UV spectral slopes (β ~ -3) within our sample, as would be expected for exotically metal-poor (Z/Z⊙ < 10−3) stellar populations with very high LyC escape fractions.
  - Our observations are consistent with model predictions that galaxies of these stellar masses at z~9-16 should have only modestly low metallicities (Z/Z⊙ ~ 0.1--0.2).

[[2311.05394\] Remarkably Compact Quiescent Candidates at $3<z <5$ in JWST-CEERS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05394)

- **Aims** The authors aim to measure the rest-frame optical and near-infrared sizes of ten quiescent candidates at $3<z<5$.
- **Methods** The measurements are based on JWST F277W and F444W imaging from CEERS programs and imcascade, an astronomical fitting code that used multi-Gaussian Expansion.
- **Results** 
  - The 80% quiescent galaxies are more compact by 40% when compared to extrapolation of rest-optical size-mass relations for quenched galaxies at low-z. Seven out of ten quiescent galaxies exhibit rest-frame IR sizes ~10% smaller than the rest-frame optical sizes, indicative of negative color gradients.
  - Two quiescent galaxies have rest-frame infrared sizes ~1.4x larger than rest-frame optical size: one exhibits signs of onging or residual star-formation, which might suggests this galaxy not be fully quenched. Another might be an AGN, because this object is not resolve in both filters.
  - Three of the most massive galaxies in the sample are extremely compact, with Re~0.7 kpc.

**Conclusions** The results indicate that quiescent galaxies may be more compact than previously anticipated beyond z > 3, even after correcting for potential color gradients. Furthermore, the size evolution of quiescent galaxies is steeper than previously anticipated and our current understanding is biased by the limited wavelength capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the presence of negative color gradients in quiescent galaxies.

[[2311.06209\] Evidence for the emergence of dust-free stellar populations at z > 10 (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06209)

**Aims** The study present a systematic analysis of the UV continuum slopes for a sample of 176 galaxy candidates at 8<z<16. These galaxies are selected from 15 independent datasets of JWST.

**Methods** The galaxy photometry is modeled covering rest-frame wavelengths less than or equal to 3000 Å. This modeling is based on a pure power-law, which includes the effects of both intergalactic medium (IGM) absorption and the Ly α damping wing.

---

See Section 2.3 for details. Here I list some bullet points about the slope measurements:

1. **Ly α Damping Wing Modeling**: For wavelengths greater than 1216 Å, the effect of the Ly α damping wing is modeled using Miralda-Escudé's method from 1998.
2. **Assumption for Wavelengths Below Ly α**: For wavelengths below Ly α (≤ 1216 Å), complete IGM attenuation is assumed, meaning the $flux_{rest}$≤1216 Å is considered zero.
3. **Parameters in the Model**: The model consists of three free parameters: β (UV continuum slope), z (redshift of the galaxy), $x_{HI}$ (neutral hydrogen fraction of the surrounding IGM)
4. **Nested Sampling and Priors**: The nested sampling code dynesty is used to sample the full posterior distribution with flat priors set for each parameter: −10 ≤ β ≤ 10; 5 ≤ z ≤ 20; and 0 ≤ �HI*x*HI ≤ 1.0.
5. **Fit Examples and Uncertainty Handling**: The paper shows examples of fits to nine galaxies, indicating how the model aligns with the observed data. A minimum uncertainty floor of Δβ = ±0.25 is adopted based on recovery simulations, particularly for objects showing unrealistically small uncertainties.
6. **Adopting Best-Fitting Redshifts**: In their analysis, the best-fitting redshifts and corresponding uncertainties derived from these fits are adopted unless stated otherwise.

---

**Results** 

- **$\beta$ - Muv** The authors claim to find evidence for a relationship between of $\beta$ and $\rm M_{UV}$ at the redshift ranges of 8<z<10, such that galaxies with bright UV magnitude display redder UV slopes, with d$\beta$/d$M_{UV}$ = -0.17. They also find that a $\beta$-Muv relation has been in place from at least z~10, with a slope that does not evolve strongly with redshift, but with an evolving normalisation such that galaxies at higher redshifts become bluer at fixed MUV. 
- **$\beta$ evolutions** They find a significant trend between β and redshift, with the inverse-variance weighted mean value evolving from ⟨β⟩=−2.17±0.05 at z=9.5 to ⟨β⟩=−2.56±0.05 at z=11.5. Based on a comparison with stellar population models, we find that at z>10.5 the average UV continuum slope is consistent with the intrinsic blue limit of `dust-free' stellar populations (βint≃−2.6). 

**Conclusions** These results suggest that the moderately dust-reddened galaxy population at z<10 was essentially dust free at z≃11. The extremely blue galaxies being uncovered at z>10 place important constraints on the dust content of early galaxies, and imply that the already observed galaxy population is likely supplying an ionizing photon budget capable of maintaining ionized IGM fractions of ≳5 per cent at z≃11.

[[2311.06348\] The effect of reionization on direct measurements of the mean free path (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06348)

**Aims**

- The primary aim is to understand how the presence of neutral islands near quasars at around z∼6 (a critical epoch in the universe's history) affects the measurements of the ionizing photon MFP.
- The study also seeks to improve the methodology for future analyses of MFP, particularly in terms of accounting for the effects of these neutral islands.

**Methods**

- The study uses radiative transfer simulations to create mock MFP measurements.
- These simulations include scenarios with and without the presence of neutral islands, allowing for a comparison of their effects on the MFP.

**Results**

- The simulations reveal that even in the presence of neutral islands, the inferred MFP approximates (within 30%) the true attenuation scale of the intergalactic medium (IGM), which includes opacity from both ionized regions and neutral islands.
- The inferred MFP is somewhat sensitive (less than 50%) to assumptions about the quasar environments and lifetimes.
- The study finds that neutral islands can significantly suppress Lyman-series transmission, but this suppression is almost entirely degenerate with spectrum normalization and thus does not significantly bias the MFP.

**Conclusions**

- Despite the challenges posed by neutral islands, the study concludes that the MFP measurements can still accurately reflect the true attenuation scale of the IGM during reionization.
- The findings suggest that future analyses might need to explicitly model the effects of neutral islands on quasar spectra to refine MFP measurements.The findings suggest that future analyses might need to explicitly model the effects of neutral islands on quasar spectra to refine MFP measurements.
- The study provides a methodology for incorporating these effects into future analyses, thereby enhancing our understanding of the reionization process and the evolution of the universe.

[[2311.06344\] Robustness of direct measurements of the mean free path of ionizing photons in the epoch of reionization (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06344)

**Aims** 

- The study aims to examine potential biases in the direct measurement of the MFP of Lyman-continuum photons, especially those measurements derived from composite spectra of multiple quasars at z∼6.
- It explores the impact of factors like quasar environment, the patchy nature of reionization, and the presence of quasar proximity zones on these measurements.

**Methods**

- The researchers employ cosmological radiative transfer simulations of reionization, combined with one-dimensional radiative transfer calculations of quasar proximity zones.
- This approach allows them to assess the influence of various environmental factors and reionization patterns (quasar environment, incomplete reionization, and quasar proximity zones) on the inferred MFP.

**Results**

- The simulations indicate that biases in the MFP measurement due to overdensities around quasars and the patchiness of reionization at z∼6 are minimal.
- The study derives a mean free path of λmfp=0.90+0.66−0.40 pMpc at z=6, aligning with recent literature measurements.

**Conclusions**

- The findings suggest that recent direct measurements of the MFP are robust and not significantly biased by the modeling of quasar proximity zones or the environmental factors around quasars.
- This conclusion supports the reliability of current methods used to measure the MFP in the context of reionization studies.

[[2311.06548\] Star-forming Main Sequence of Giant Low Surface Brightness Galaxies (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06548)

**Aims** 

- The study focuses on understanding the star formation, evolution, and gas content characteristics of 27 local GLSBGs.
- It aims to compare these galaxies with normal star-forming galaxies (SFGs) to discern their unique features.

**Methods**

- The researchers collected data on 27 local GLSBGs, analyzing their stellar masses (M*), star formation rates (SFRs), specific SFRs (sSFRs), and gas content (both HI and H2).
- The study uses the star-forming main sequence (MS) defined by previous works (E07 and S16) as a benchmark for comparison.

**Results**

- GLSBGs are found to have high stellar masses (M*>10^10 Msolar) but low SFRs, with sSFRs lower than the characteristic value for local SFGs.
- These galaxies are rich in HI gas but have little molecular hydrogen (H2), suggesting a low efficiency in converting HI to H2.
- The study reveals that the central, bulge-dominated parts of GLSBGs contribute to pulling the galaxies off from the MS due to their lower SFRs and higher M$*$. In contrast, the outer, disk-dominated parts have relatively higher SFRs and lower M$*$, aligning more closely with the MS.
- The NUV-r versus g-r color analysis shows that the outer parts of GLSBGs are blue like normal SFGs, while the inner parts are generally red, suggesting an inside-out star formation mechanism.

[[2311.07122\] On the Dust properties of the UV galaxies in the redshift range $z \sim 0.6-1.2$ (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07122)

**Aims** The study aims to estimate the infrared (IR) properties of galaxies selected in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) range.

**Methods** 

- **Sample** The authors stack 100 um, 160 um (Herschel Space Observatory, PACS), 250 um, 350 um, 600 um (Herschel Space Observatory, CDFS) on a source list of galaxies selected in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) in a redshift range of 0.6−1.2. The calalog is selected using observations from XMM-OM UVW1 (2910 A).
- **Photometry**  The stacked data are binned according to the UV luminosity function (LF) of these sources, and the average photometry of the UV-selected galaxies is estimated.
- **SED** By fitting modified black bodies and IR model templates to the stacked photometry, average dust temperatures and total IR luminosity are determined.

**Results** 

- The luminosity-weighted average dust temperatures show no significant evolution between the redshift bins centered at 0.7 and 1.0.
- The infrared excess (IRX), unobscured, and obscured star formation rate (SFR) values are derived from the UV and IR luminosities. Dust attenuation is found to be constant for UV luminosities above \num{9e10} L⊙ but increases as UV luminosity decreases below this threshold. Dust attenuation is consistent across the luminosity range of the sources at fixed redshift when considered as a function of IR luminosities.
- The star-forming galaxies at higher redshifts in this sample exhibit lower dust attenuation compared to local luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) with similar SFRs.

**Conclusions**

- The study concludes that the dust-corrected star formation rate densities (SFRDs) in the redshift range of 0.6 to 1.2 are consistent with measurements from IR-selected samples at the same redshifts.
- It suggests that higher redshift star-forming galaxies have different dust attenuation properties compared to their local counterparts.

[[2311.07019\] Compact to extended Lyman-$α$ emitters in MAGI: strong blue peak emission at $z\gtrsim3$ (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07019)

**Aims** 

- To investigate three double-peaked Lyman-α emitters (LAEs) with strong blue peak emissions found at redshifts between 2.9 and 4.8.
- To understand the scattering of Lyα photons by neutral hydrogen (H i), suggesting gas inflows and low H i column density in these galaxies.

**Methods**

- Utilizing data from the VLT/MUSE instrument as part of the Middle Ages Galaxy Properties with Integral Field Spectroscopy (MAGPI) survey.
- Analyzing the spatial and spectral properties of these LAEs, focusing on their Lyα emission.

**Results**

- Discovery of two spatially extended halos at z = 2.9 and z = 3.6, featuring stronger blue peak emissions in their core regions compared to the red peak. These halos exhibit spatial variations in peak ratio and peak separation over large areas (25 × 26 kpc and 19 × 28 kpc).
- Identification of a compact LAE system at z ∼ 4.8, spanning a 9 × 9 kpc region, as the highest-redshift strong blue peak emitter detected to date.
- Measurement of peak separations in the bright cores of these systems, ranging from ∆peak ∼ 370 to 660 km/s, with a trend of decreasing peak separation with increasing radius.

**Conclusions**

- The study provides new insights into the scattering behavior of Lyα photons and gas kinematics in high-redshift galaxies.
- The observed properties of these LAEs, especially the extended halos, make them promising candidates for Lyman Continuum (LyC) leakers.
- The findings highlight the complex interplay between Lyα emission, gas kinematics, and ionizing radiation properties in the evolution and nature of high-redshift galaxies.

[[2311.07483\] The galaxies missed by Hubble and ALMA: the contribution of extremely red galaxies to the cosmic census at $3<z<8$ (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07483)

**Aims** The authors characterize optically-faint and extremely red galaxies at z>3 that were previously missing from galaxy census estimates, leveaging the deep JWST data. The data indicate the existence of abundant, dusty and post-starburst-like galaxies down to sensitivity limit of Spizter and ALMA.

**Methods**  

- The properties are derived by fitting SED to the broadband fluxes. However, including 7 MIRI filters out to 21 um results in decreased mass (median 0.6 dex for logM >10) and SFR (median 10x for SFR>100Msol/yr).

**Results**

- At z>6, the sample includes a high fraction of little red dots (LRD), which is NIRCam-selected-dust-reddened AGN candidates, with measurements indicating older stellar populations and ruling out significant hot dust emission (common in AGN).
- These LRDs potentially double the obscured fraction of the star formation rate density at 4<z<6, suggesting previous underestimation of obscured contributions from fainter sources.

**Conclusions** 

- The study concludes that the obscured star formation in the universe at redshifts between 4 and 6 was likely underestimated before the JWST era.
- It also highlights the importance of JWST's capability to detect fainter sources that were previously missed, significantly contributing to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in the early universe.
- The findings suggest a need for spectroscopic follow-up to further understand the nature of these sources, especially the five identified sources with potential Balmer breaks and high stellar masses at 5.5<z<7.7.

[[2311.08065\] Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey: The colour evolution of galaxies in the distant Universe (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08065)

- **Aims and Background**: The author present a forward-model way to study the color of high-z galaxies. Although the SED fit could inference the important physical properties of galaxies, the inference of these properies could lead to large uncentainies and potenital bias, especially based on the photometric data alone. it is now possible, and common, for simulations to be forward-modelled to yield synthetic observations that can be compared directly to real observations.
- **Methods** Using CEERS data, they measure the fluxes and color of high-z galaxies (z>4). They compare their measurments with the predictions made by a varity of models generated using the same methods.
- **Results** In general, the measurments agree with the predictions at relatively low redshift (5<z<8). However, at the high redshift (z>8), there is some disagrement between the measurements and the predictions. However, the high-z sample is samll, so the distributions of observed value is susceptible to statistical fluctuations.

[[2311.11569] Lyman-alpha at Cosmic Noon I: Ly-alpha Spectral Type Selection of z ~ 2-3 Lyman Break Galaxies with Broadband Imaging (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10985)

- **Aims** The studies try to establish the link between the net Lyman alpha equivalent width and the broadband photometric properties of LBGs at the redshift of 2. This link could be used to purposefully select LBGs with specific EW(Ly-alpha).
- **Methods** They show that LBGs wit the strongest net Lay EW in absorption distributions in (U-R) and R-band magnitude space, and use this segregation behavior to determine photometric criteria by which sub-samples with a desired Lya spectral type can be selected.
- **Results** They use spectrophotometry of composite spectra derived from a sample of 798 LBGs divided into quartiles on the basis of net Lya EW to calculate criteria for the selection of Lya absorbing and Lya emitting populations of z~3 LBGs using ugri broadband photometric data from the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).

[[2311.11569] A proto-cluster of massive quiescent galaxies at z=4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11569)

**Aims** The study report on discovery of a concentration of massive quiescent galaxies located at z=4.

**Methods** The concentration is firstly identified using the multi-band photometric data in Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Field. Follow-up near-infrared spectroscopic observations with MOSFIRE on Keck confirm a massive (~10^{11} Msun) quiescent galaxy at z=3.99.  The SED fitting is used to derive the star-forming history and the physical properties.

**Results** 

- They confirm a massive (~10^11 Msun) quiescent galaxy at z=3.99, with evidence of a starburst event around 500 million years prior, followed by rapid quenching. Furthermore, a probable (proto-)cluster consisting of this galaxy and four surrounding massive (>10^10 Msun) quiescent galaxies within approximately 1 physical Mpc scale, all likely at the same redshift.
- Lack of similar concentrations in the Illustris-TNG300 simulation, indicating the rarity of such a system.

**Conclusions** The study potentially identifies the first cluster dominated by quiescent galaxies at such a high redshift (z=4). The combined halo mass of these galaxies (~10^13 Msun) suggests they may form a group-sized halo in the future.

[[2311.12234] A Steep Decline in the Galaxy Space Density Beyond Redshift 9 in the CANUCS UV Luminosity Function (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12234)

**Aims** The authors present a new sample of 158 galaxies at redshift z>7.5 selected from deep JWST/NIRCam imaging of five widely-separated sightline in the CANUCS survey. 

**Methods** The CANUCS survey provide the data that two-thirds of the pointing and 80% of the galaxies are covered by 12 to 14 NIRCam filters, including seven to nine medium filter. With multi-band data including medium band data, they could measure the phot-z accurately. A sample of 28 galaxies at z>7.5 with spectroscopic redshifts shows a low systematic offset and scatter in the difference between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts.

**Results** The normalization of derived UVLF are slightly higher than that of derived based on the HST observations. They observe a steeper decline in the galaxy space density from z8-12 than found by most JWST Cycle 1 studies. They only find eight galaxies at z>10 and none at z>12.5, with no z>10 galaxies brighter than F277W AB=28. They attribute the lack of bright z>10 galaxies in CANUCS compared to GLASS and CEERS to intrinsic variance in the galaxy density along different sightlines.

**Conclusions** The evolution in the CANUCS luminosity function between z=8 and 12 is comparable to that predicted by simulations that assume a standard star formation efficiency, without invoking any special adjustments.

[[2311.12691] MIDIS: The Relation between Strong (Hb+[OIII]) Emission, Star Formation and Burstiness Around the Epoch of Reionization (arXiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12691)

**Aims** The primary objective is to explore the properties of galaxies that exhibit strong (Hβ+[OIII]) emission lines during and after the Epoch of Reionization.

**Methods** The team utilizes ultra-deep imaging from the JWST/NIRCam in the Parallel Field of the MIRI Deep Infrared Survey (MIDIS) within the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (P2-XDF). They select galaxies showing significant flux enhancement in the F356W band, indicative of strong (Hβ+[OIII]) emission. The sample is augmented with data from other similar emitters found in scientific literature.

**Results**:

- Anti-correlations are found between the equivalent width of (Hβ+[OIII]) and both the stellar mass and age of the galaxies. A positive correlation exists between the equivalent width and the specific star formation rate (sSFR)
- On the star formation rate (SFR) versus stellar mass (M*) plane, these emitters are found in both the star-formation main sequence and starburst regions. This trend becomes less distinct at lower stellar masses. 

**Conclusions**

- The study reveals that both strong (Hβ+[OIII]) emitters and other types of galaxies at this epoch share many properties, including often having high sSFR.
- This similarity between emitters and non-emitters is important for understanding the broader context of star formation activity around the Epoch of Reionization.
- The non-monotonic relationship between emission line strength and SFR, especially at lower SFRs, suggests that factors like low metallicity might be significant in driving high emission line strengths in these galaxies.
