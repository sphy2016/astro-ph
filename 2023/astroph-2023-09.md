[[2309.06311\] Spatially-resolved Spectroscopic Analysis of Ly$α$ Haloes: Radial Evolution of the Ly$α$ Line Profile out to 60 kpc (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06311)

**Aims: ** Understand the origin of the Lyman alpha halos surrounding Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) at 3<z<4.

**Methods used: ** The authors analyze the average spatial extend and spectral variation of the circumgalactic LAHs by stacking a sample of 155 Ly$\alpha$ emitters at 3<z<4 in the MXDF.

**Results: **

- With respect to the Lyα red peak of the target LAE, the Lyα line peak becomes increasingly more blueshifted out to a projected distance of at least 60 kpc, where the velocity offset is ≈ 250 km/s. 
- This signal is observed in both the mean and median stacks, and is thus a generic property of the LAE sample with typical Lyα luminosity ≈1041.1ergs−1. 

**Conclusions:**

- The most plausible scenarios is a combination of outflows and inflows. In the inner region of the LAH, the Lyα photons are produced by the central star formation and then scattered within outflows. At larger radii, the infalling cool gas shapes the observed Lyα blueshift.

[[2309.06319\] Spatially-resolved H$α$ and ionizing photon production efficiency in the lensed galaxy MACS1149-JD1 at a redshift of 9.11 (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06319)

**Aims: ** Observe the lensed galaxy MACS1149-JD1 at a redshift of z = 9.1092 to understand its structure, star formation rate, ionizing photon production efficiency, and Hα kinematics.

**Methods used: ** Employed medium-resolution spectroscopy (MRS) and imaging (MIRIM) using MIRI/JWST.

**Results: **

- The authors detected spatially-resolved Hα emission from MACS1149-JD1. The structure of the Hα emitting gas consists of two clumps, S and N, which contribute 60% and 40% of the total flux, respectively.
- The authors derived the instantaneous star formation rate of 3.2 ± 0.3 to 5.3 ± 0.4 M⊙ yr−1 and the ionizing photon production efficiency shows a spatially-resolved structure with values of 25.55 ± 0.03, 25.47 ± 0.03, and 25.91 ± 0.09 Hz erg−1
- The rest-frame equivalent width, EW0 (Hα), for the entire galaxy and individual clumps was calculated, with clump N showing signs of a recent starburst.
- Clump S and N displayed different Hα kinematics, with distinct velocity dispersions. Estimated the dynamical mass based on the size of the integrated Hα ionized nebulae and its velocity dispersion, finding consistency with previous measurements.

**Conclusion:**

- The structure and properties of MACS1149-JD1 suggest it began forming stars around a redshift of z ∼ 11-12.

- Differences in EW0 (Hα) between the clumps indicate that the star formation history varied within the galaxy, with clump N experiencing a more recent burst of star formation.
- The derived ionizing photon production efficiency is consistent with that observed in other high-redshift galaxies but is above the canonical value.
- The distinct kinematics of clumps S and N may hint at the presence of outflows or increased turbulence in clump N.

- Overall, the study of MACS1149-JD1 provides important insights into galaxy formation and evolution during the Universe's early epochs.

[[2309.05714\] UNCOVER spectroscopy confirms a surprising ubiquity of AGN in red galaxies at $z>5$ (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05714)

**Aims：**

- Investigate a new population of dust-reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshifts (z≳5) using JWST.

- Clarify the nature of these AGN candidates, which were selected due to their unique photometric properties and determine the proportion that are truly AGN.

**Methods used: **

- Employed deep NIRSpec/Prism spectroscopy from the UNCOVER Cycle 1 Treasury program.
- Selected AGN candidates based on their compact nature and specific photometric criteria (red in the rest-frame optical but blue in the UV).
- Used NIRCam photometry to differentiate between dusty star formation or AGN activity.
- Proposed an updated photometric criterion to better select red z>5 AGN.

**Results:**

- Found that the majority (60%) of the compact red sources in UNCOVER are dust-reddened AGN with broad-line Hα emission, 20% were inconclusive, and 20% were identified as brown dwarf stars. The proposed photometric criterion is expected to yield a selection efficiency of over 80% for AGN.
- The confirmed AGN have black hole masses ranging from 10^7 to 10^9 M⊙. Their UV luminosities are low compared to other UV-selected AGN at the same epochs, but the bolometric luminosities suggest they are significant AGN. The number densities of these AGN are high, making them much more common than the faintest UV-selected quasars.

**Conclusions: **

- The majority of the compact red sources in the UNCOVER sample are dust-reddened AGN. An updated photometric criterion can enhance the efficiency of AGN selection at high redshifts.
- These AGN have significant black hole masses and are surprisingly common at these epochs.
- Even though their UV-faint nature suggests they might not play a major role in reionization, their prevalence presents challenges to existing models of black hole growth in the early universe.

**Aims: ** 

- The author presents first results of Web Epoch of Reionization Lyman-alpha Survey (WERLS) and present its initial findings. The WERLS survey aims to observe the Lyman alpha emission from bright galaxy during the EoR in three fields: CEERS, PRIMER, and COSMOS-Web

**Methods: **

- The spectroscopic survey uses the Keck I/MOSFIRE and LRIS.
- The pre-selection sample consist of the bright galaxy (J < 26 mag) with UV magnitude between -23.1 and -19.8 at 5.5<z<8.

**Results: **

- Based on first 5 nights observations, 11 z~7-8 LAEs are detected, including 3 securely detected and 8 tentatively detected. The estimated LAE yield is approximately 13%, aligning with expectations considering factors like redshift uncertainty, contamination from sky OH lines, and the Universe's ionization status.
- Observation of two LAEs at z = 7.68 raised the possibility of the existence of an ionized bubble at this redshift.

**Conclusions: **

- Future synergistic Keck+JWST efforts will provide a powerful tool for pinpointing beacons of reionization and mapping the large scale distribution of mass relative to the ionization state of the Universe.

[[2309.07969\] A massive compact quiescent galaxy at z=2 with a complete Einstein ring in JWST imaging (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07969)

**Background: **

- One of the significant discoveries from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was that many of the most massive galaxies at z~2 (when the universe was roughly 3 billion years old) were surprisingly compact, with half-light radii of just 1-2 kpc.
- The observed compactness suggested that massive galaxies formed "inside-out." This means the inner regions or cores of these galaxies were largely formed by z~2, with about half of the present-day mass of these galaxies added later primarily through minor mergers with smaller galaxies.

**Methods:**

- The researchers identified a compact, massive, quiescent galaxy at a photometric redshift (zphot) of 1.94+0.13−0.17. This galaxy creates a complete Einstein ring due to the gravitational lensing effect caused by a more distant background galaxy at zphot=2.98+0.42−0.47.

**Results:**

- In this case, the ring provides a direct measurement of the mass of the core of this massive foreground galaxy. Observing this galaxy provides a unique opportunity to study the properties of a "pristine" core (one not yet affected by later mergers and evolution) of a massive galaxy.
- The mass within the core of the galaxy (within a radius of 6.6 kpc) is found to be Mlens=6.5+3.7−1.5×1011 Msun. The stellar mass within the same region is Mstars=1.1+0.2−0.3×1011 Msun, assuming a Chabrier initial mass function (IMF). The estimated dark matter mass within that region is Mdm=2.6+1.6−0.7×1011 Msun.

**Conclusions:** 

- There's a discrepancy between the lensing mass measurements and the sum of the measured stellar and dark matter masses. This suggests there's missing mass that hasn't been accounted for. Possible explanations for this missing mass include either a higher-than-expected concentration of dark matter in the galaxy's core or a bottom-heavy initial mass function (IMF).

[[2309.07834\] DUALZ: Deep UNCOVER-ALMA Legacy High-Z Survey (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07834)

**Aims: **

- The authors present the design and the initial findings of the ALMA cycle 9 DUALZ program. The survey aims to establish a joint ALMA and JWST public legacy field targeting the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744.

**Methods:**

- The observations used a 4'x6' ALMA mosaic in Band 6 to observe areas of magnification u>2 down to a sensitivity level of $\rm \sigma=32.7\ \mu Jy$. The survey aims to conduct a blind search to identify dust continuum sources. The NIRSpec/Prism observations are used to confirm the redshift of the objects (27 objects are confirmed). For the rest of objects, they used the comprehensive HST, NIRCam, and ALMA data for estimating photometric redshifts.

**Results:**

- The survey identify 69 dust continuum sources with a median redshift of z=2.3 and intrinsic 1.2-mm flux of $\rm S_{1.2mm}^{int} = 0.24\ mJy$. Among these objects, there are 27 objects confirmed spectroscopilly. The authors identify a [CII] 158um emitter at z=6.3254.
- The NIRCam counterparts of the 1.2-mm continuum sources showed undisturbed morphologies, typically of either disk or spheroid structures. This suggests that the faint mm emission is likely not a result of catastrophic events such as mergers.
- The authors Identified 8 HST-dark and 2 JWST-dark galaxy candidates among the ALMA continuum sources.
- Detected faint dust emission from an X-ray-detected galaxy at zspec=10.07, suggesting simultaneous evolution of the galaxy's central black hole and its host.

**Conclusions:**

- The public release of the reduced ALMA data, including mosaic maps, cubes, and the source catalog, will facilitate various scientific endeavors by the broader community.

[[2309.08515\] MIDIS. JWST NIRCam and MIRI unveil the stellar population properties of Ly$α$-emitters and Lyman-Break galaxies at z ~ 3-7 (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08515)

**Aims: ** To investigate the stellar population properties of Lyman-α emitters (LAEs) and Lyman-Break galaxies (LBGs) at redshifts z = 2.8 - 6.7 in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF).

**Methods: ** The sample consists of 182 Lyman-alpha emitters and 450 photometrically-selected Lyman-Break galaxies at $z=2.8-6.7$ in XDF. Analysis of their rest-frame UV-through-near-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using combined HST and JWST NIRCam and MIRI observations.

**Results:** 

- The studied LAEs are typically low-mass with little to no dust extinction and exhibit a blue UV continuum slope. When comparing the properties of LAEs to a stellar-mass matched sample of LBGs, the two populations are largely similar, except for the LBGs having a redder UV continuum slope and slightly higher E(B - V) values.
- Notably, 48% of LBGs are young starbursts that surprisingly lack detectable Lyα emission, which could be due to factors like HI resonant scattering or selective dust extinction.
- While the majority (75%) of LAEs are young (< 100 Myr), 25% possess considerably older stellar populations. Older LAEs tend to be more massive, less extinct, and exhibit lower specific star formation rates than their younger counterparts. They are also observed to populate the main-sequence of star-forming galaxies. Young LAEs, conversely, populate the starburst region.

**Conclusions:**

- The JWST observations play a vital role in accurately determining the properties of LAEs.
- The study sheds light on the distinct properties and similarities between the LAEs and LBGs, emphasizing the significance of the JWST in this line of research.

[[2309.10191\] The One-hundred-deg^2 DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN): Survey Design and Science Goals (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10191)

**Aims: ** The paper presents the survey design and objectives of ODIN (One-hundred-deg^2 DECam Imaging in Narrowbands), aiming to achieve deep narrow-band imaging over an extensive sky area.

**Methods: **  The authors plan to use the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) to obtain deep (AB~25.7) narrow-band images over an unprecedented area of sky. The three custom-built narrow-band filters, N419, N501, and N673, have central wavelengths of 419, 501, and 673 nm and respective full-widthat-half-maxima of 7.2, 7.4, and 9.8 nm, corresponding to Lya at z=2.4, 3.1, and 4.5 and cosmic times of 2.8, 2.1, and 1.4 Gyr, respectively.

**Results: ** The ODIN narrow-band images will enable the selection of over 100,000 Lya-emitting (LAE) galaxies at these epochs. ODIN-selected LAEs will identify protoclusters as galaxy overdensities, and the deep narrow-band images enable detection of highly extended Lya blobs (LABs).

**Primary goals: **

1. ODIN serves as a strategic initiative to understand the clustering strength, dark matter halo connections of LAEs, LABs, and protoclusters, as well as their affiliation with cosmic web filaments.
2. Investigating these properties across three epochs will shed light on their redshift evolution during Cosmic Noon, a period when star formation was most prolific.
3. Additional benefits include studies of lower-redshift emission-line galaxy samples and probing nearby star-forming galaxies segmented into various [O III] and [S II] emitting zones.

[[2309.14431\] GA-NIFS: co-evolution within a highly star-forming galaxy group at z=3.7 witnessed by JWST/NIRSpec IFS (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14431)

**Aims: **The authors present the results of a NIRSpec/IFS observation of a galaxy group around the massive GS_4891 galaxy. The system includes two other systems.

**Methods: ** The authors used the NIRSpec IFS mode to observe this system, leveraging the wide wavelength range spanned with the high-dispersion grating (R=2700).They explore the spatial distribution of star-formation rate, nebular attenuation and gas metallicity, together with the mechanisms responsible for the excitation of the ionized gas

**Results: ** 

1. GS_4891 exhibits a clear gas metallicity gradient (as traced by 12 + log(O/H)) of more than 0.2 dex from the southeast to the northwest. Gas metallicity in the less massive northern system, GS_4891_n, is higher by 0.2 dex compared to the center of GS_4891, hinting that higher-mass systems might favor inflows of lower-metallicity gas.
2. The kinematic analysis shows that GS_4891 presents velocity gradients in the ionized gas consistent with rotation. The region between GS_4891 and GS_4891_n does not present high gas turbulence which, together with the difference in gas metallicities, suggests that these two systems might be in a pre-merger stage.
3. GS_4891 hosts an ionized outflow that extends out to rout=1.2 kpc from the nucleus and reaches maximum velocities rout of approximately 400 km/s. Despite entraining an outflowing mass rate of M˙ out ∼ 2 M⊙/yr, the low associated mass-loading factor, η ∼ 0.05, implies that the outflow does not have a significant impact on the star-formation activity of the galaxy

**Aims: ** The authors discuss measurements of the stellar population and star-forming properties for 43  spectroscopically confirmed galaxies. 

**Methods:** They carry out a thorough study investigating the relationship between spectroscopic features and photometrically derived ones, including from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of models, as well as morphological and structural properties.

1. SED-derived properties v.s. Measurements based on line from spec.
2. How well equivalent widths of H-beta, [O III] doublet could be determined from photometry.
3. a stack of the line emitting galaxies after subtracting imaging that contains only the continuum

**Results:** 

1. The SFRs derived from H𝛽 line emission were found to be higher (with ratios SFRH𝛽/SFRUV ranging from ∼ 2 - 13) than those estimated from Bayesian SED fitting and UV luminosity, indicating a continuously rising star formation history given the timescales of H𝛽 versus UV star formation probes.
2. The EW derived from photometric excesses in filters was on average 30% smaller than the direct spectroscopic measurement.
3. A distinct morphology in the stack of the line-emitting galaxies was uncovered after subtracting imaging containing only the continuum, providing a first view of line or ionized gas emission from 𝑧 > 7 galaxies. This analysis demonstrates that the material has a statistically similar distribution as the continuum.

4. Upon comparing derived SFRs and stellar masses for both parametric and non-parametric star formation histories, it was discovered that 35% of the sample had formed at least 30% of their stellar mass in recent (< 10 Myr) starburst events.

[[2309.15671\] MIDIS: Unveiling the Role of Strong Ha-emitters during the Epoch of Reionization with JWST (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15671)

**Aims: ** We make use of the deepest JWST/MIRI image at 5.6 µm, in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field, to constrain the role of strong Hα emitters (HAEs) in Cosmic Reionization at z ≃ 7 − 8.

**Methods:** The study considers a sample of bright HAEs (M(UV) < -20 mag) that are young (age < 30 Myr) and of low stellar mass (≤ 10^9 M☉). These galaxies exhibit a wide range of UV-beta slopes with a median value of β = -2.22±0.35, where β is indicative of dust content and star-formation history. It is noted that β broadly correlates with stellar mass.

**Results: ** 

1. Assuming an escape fraction of ionizing radiation of zero (f_esc,LyC = 0), the median ionizing photon production efficiency is estimated to be log10(ξ_ion,0/(Hz erg^(-1))) = 25.54(+0.09, -0.10). Based on β values, the escape fraction of ionizing radiation is estimated to be f_esc,LyC=0.07(+0.03, -0.02). which results in log10(ξion/(Hz erg−1 )) = 25.59+0.06 −0.04.
2. A positive correlation is observed between ξ_ion,0, EW0(Hα) (equivalent width of Hα), and specific star formation rate (sSFR). Conversely, ξion,0 is found to weakly anti-correlate with stellar mass and β.
3. The HAEs in this sample are found to be capable of contributing significantly to Cosmic Reionization at z~7-8 without requiring high values of relative escape fraction (only 6-10%). The rate of ionizing photon production is given as N_dot_ion = 10^(50.43±0.3) s^(-1)Mpc^(-3), indicating a substantial contribution to the ionizing photon budget.

**Conclusions:**

1. These strong, young, and low stellar-mass emitters could have played a central role during the Epoch of Reionization, emitting more ionizing photons per comoving volume compared to non-Hα emitters at the same redshift.

[[2309.15720\] Identification of a transition from stochastic to secular star formation around $z=9$ with JWST (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15720)

**Aims:** The author Investigate the variability in the Star Formation Histories (SFH) of early galaxies (6<z<12) based on their stellar mass and redshift, using the James Webb Space Telescope Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) public catalog as well as explore how the star-formation behavior transitions from stochastic to a more secular mode as we move to lower redshifts (z≲6).

**Methods: **

- Employed the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) modeling code CIGALE to derive the physical attributes of the galaxies and their SFHs.
- Implemented a non-parametric SFH with a flat prior to allow for maximum stochasticity.
- Utilized the Star Formation Rate (SFR) gradient as an indicator to assess the movement of galaxies on the SFR-M* plane, which reflects their recent SFH.

**Results:**

- At z>9, 87% of massive galaxies (log(M*/M⊙)≳9) exhibit SFR gradients consistent with stochastic star-formation activity over the recent 100 Myr, but this fraction drops to 15% at z<7.
- A growing fraction of galaxies shows star-formation activity aligning with a common stream on the SFR-M* plane over cosmic time, suggesting an emerging secular mode of star-formation.
- Estimated σUV, the dispersion in the UV absolute magnitude distribution, to be around 1.2 magnitudes, relating it to the observed excess of UV emission at z≳10.

[[2309.15986\] The COSMOS-Web ring: in-depth characterization of an Einstein ring lensing system at z~2 (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15986)

**Aims:** We provide an in-depth analysis of the COSMOS-Web ring, an Einstein ring at z=2 that we serendipitously discovered in the COSMOS-Web survey and possibly the most distant lens discovered to date.

**Methods:** 

1. We extract the visible and NIR photometry from more than 25 bands and we derive the photometric redshifts and physical properties of both the lens and the source with three different SED fitting codes.
2. Using JWST/NIRCam images, we also produce two lens models to (i) recover the total mass of the lens, (ii) derive the magnification of the system, (iii) reconstruct the morphology of the lensed source, and (iv) measure the slope of the total mass density profile of the lens.

**Results:** 

1. The lens is a very massive and quiescent (sSFR < 10(-13) yr-1) elliptical galaxy at z = 2.02 \pm 0.02 with a total mass Mtot(<thetaE) = (3.66 \pm 0.36) x 10^11 Msun and a stellar mass M* = (1.37 \pm 0.14) x 10^11 Msun. 
2. Compared to SHMRs from the literature, we find that the total mass is consistent with the presence of a DM halo of mass Mh = 1.09^(+1.46)_(-0.57) x 10^13 Msun. 
3. In addition, the background source is a M* = (1.26 \pm 0.17) x 10^10 Msun star-forming galaxy (SFR=(78 \pm 15) Msun/yr) at z = 5.48 \pm 0.06. Its reconstructed morphology shows two components with different colors. Dust attenuation values from SED fitting and nearby detections in the FIR also suggest it could be partially dust-obscured.

**Conclusions:**

1. We find the lens at z=2. Its total, stellar, and DM halo masses are consistent within the Einstein ring, so we do not need any unexpected changes in our description of the lens (e.g. change its IMF or include a non-negligible gas contribution). The most likely solution for the lensed source is at z = 5.5. Its reconstructed morphology is complex and highly wavelength dependent, possibly because it is a merger or a main sequence galaxy with a heterogeneous dust distribution.

**Aims:** The authors aims to study the molecular content in a sample of $z=6.5-7.5$ galaxies.

**Methods:** We use the 158μm [CII] fine-structure emission line as a tracer of the molecular gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) in a sample of z=6.5−7.5 galaxies recently unveiled by the Reionization Era Bright Line Emission Survey, REBELS, with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array.

**Results:**

1. We find substantial amounts of molecular gas ($\sim 10^{10.5}\ M_{\odot}$) comparable to those found in lower redshift galaxies for similar stellar masses ($\sim 10^{10.5}\ M_{\odot}$).
2. The REBELS galaxies appear to follow the standard scaling relations of molecular gas to stellar mass ratio ($\mu_{mol}$) and gas depletion timescale ($t_{dep}$) with distance to the star-forming main-sequence expected from extrapolations of z∼1−4 observations.
3. We find median values at $z \sim 7$of $\mu_{mol}=2.6^{4.1}_{-1.4}$ and $t_{dep}=0.5^{+0.26}_{−0.14}$ Gyr, indicating that the baryonic content of these galaxies is gas-phase dominated and little evolution from z∼7 to 4. 
4. Our measurements of the cosmic density of molecular gas, log$(ρ_{mol}/(M⊙Mpc−3))=6.34^{+0.34}_{−0.31}$, indicate a steady increase by an order of magnitude from z∼7 to 4.

[[2309.16531\] Revisiting Galaxy Evolution in Morphology in the COSMOS field (COSMOS-ReGEM):I. Merging Galaxies (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16531)

**Aims：** The authors revisit the evolution of galaxy morphology in the COSMOS field over the redshift range $0.2<z<1$, using a large and complete sample of 33,605 galaxies with a stellar mass of log($M_{*}/M_{\odot}$) > 9.5 with significant improved redshift and comprehensive non-parametric morphological parameters.

**Methods:**

1. Our sample has 13,881 (∼41.3%) galaxies with reliable spectroscopic redshifts and has more accurate photometric redshifts with a σNMAD∼0.005. 
2. They visual inspect all the galaxies to select the massive galaxy pair and major merger.

**Results:** 

1. We identify 3,594 major merging galaxies through visual inspection and find 1,737 massive galaxy pairs with log(M∗/M⊙)>10.1. 
2.  Among the family of non-parametric morphological parameters including C, A, S, Gini, $M_{20}$, $A_{O}$, and $D_{O}$, we find that the outer asymmetry parameter $A_{O}$,and the second-order momentum parameter $M_{20}$are the best tracers of merging features than other combinations. Hence, we propose a criterion for selecting candidates of violently star-forming mergers: $M_{20}$>−3$A_{O}$+3 at $0.2<z<0.6$ and $M_{20}$>−$A_{O}$+3.7 at $0.6<z<1.0$.
3. Furthermore, we show that both the visual merger sample and the pair sample exhibit a similar evolution in the merger rate at z<1, with $R\sim(1+z)^{1.79±0.13}$ for the visual merger sample and $R∼(1+z)^{2.02±0.42}$ for the pair sample

**Conclusion:**

1.  The visual merger sample has a specific star formation rate that is about 0.16 dex higher than that of non-merger galaxies, whereas no significant star formation excess is observed in the pair sample. This suggests that the effects of mergers on star formation differ at different merger stages.
