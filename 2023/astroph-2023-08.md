[[2308.00041\] UV-Bright Star-Forming Clumps and Their Host Galaxies in UVCANDELS at 0.5 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 1 (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00041)

**Aims: ** The authors aim to detect and analyze giant star-forming clumps in galaxies at 0.5<z<1, connecting two epoch when clumps are common (z~2) and rare (z~0).

**Methods: ** The authors used the F275W images from UVCANDELS to construct a clump sample whose rest-frame 1600A luminosity is 3 times higher than the most luminous local HII regions.

**Results: ** 

- **Frequency of Clumps:** Clumpy galaxies (with off-center clumps) were found in varying percentages across low-mass (35%), intermediate-mass (22%), and high-mass (22%) galaxies.
- **Characteristics of Clumpy vs. Non-Clumpy SFGs:** Clumpy SFGs in the low and intermediate mass range had higher star formation rates (SFRs) and bluer U-V colors, while high-mass clumpy SFGs were larger. However, both clumpy and non-clumpy SFGs had similar Sérsic indices, reflecting a similar underlying density profile.
- **Luminosity Correlations:** More luminous star-forming regions were generally found in more luminous, smaller, higher-specific SFR galaxies, and closer to the galactic center.

**Aims: ** The study presents the follow-up spectroscopic observations of f a highly magnified star candidate at z_phot ~ 4.8, which is previously detected in JWST/NIRCam imaging of the strong lensing (SL) cluster MACS J0647+7015 (z=0.591).

**Methods: ** The authors analyze the spectrum obtained by the JWST/NIRSpec. The researchers considered two scenarios: stars and star clusters.

**Results: **

- **Redshift Measurement:** The host arc's redshift was measured as z_spec=4.758±0.004.
- **Star's Properties:** The spectrum suggests the star is a B-type super-giant with a surface temperature of approximately 15,000 K. Additionally, either a redder F-type companion or significant dust attenuation is suggested.
- **Consistency with Star Cluster:** The spectrum is found to be consistent with a star cluster, though this scenario presents some challenges. However, The lack of a counter image and constraints on the object's size limit the likelihood of this scenarios.

**Conclusions: **The study showcases JWST's capability to study early stars through extreme lensing. While the analysis strongly suggests the observed object is a magnified star with specific characteristics, a scenario where it's a young globular cluster is not entirely ruled out by the current data. Further observations and analysis might be required to definitively distinguish between these possibilities.

[[2308.00745\] Tracing the Total Stellar Mass and Star Formation of High-Redshift Protoclusters (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00745)

**Aims: ** The study aims to investigate the properties of protoclusters, specifically the total stellar mass and star formation within these structures, including the contributions from faint, undetected members

**Methods: ** The authors conducted a stacking analysis of 211 protoclusters that were selected as Planck cold sources from the z=2−4 range. They used WISE and Herschel/SPIRE images to measure the angular size and spectral energy distribution of the integrated light from the protoclusters. Additionally, they estimated the contamination from line-of-sight interlopers using the WebSky simulation, and corrected the results accordingly.

**Results: ** After correcting for potential contamination, the authors obtained a total star formation rate of 7.3±3.2×10^3 M⊙yr^−1 and a total stellar mass of 4.9±2.2×10^12 M⊙. They discovered that protoclusters, on average, have 2x more star formation and 4x more stellar mass than the total contribution from individually-detected galaxies in spectroscopically-confirmed protoclusters. They also found that much of the total flux comes from galaxies with luminosities below the detection limit of SPIRE. Furthermore, protoclusters were found to subtend a half-light radius of 2.8' (4.2-5.8 cMpc), which is consistent with simulations.

**Conclusions: ** The study concludes that protoclusters contain more star formation and stellar mass than previously detected by current methods. The results suggest that a significant portion of the flux within protoclusters comes from faint galaxies below the detection limit. 

[[2308.00751\] Unveiling the distant Universe: Characterizing $z\ge9$ Galaxies in the first epoch of COSMOS-Web (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00751)

**Aims: ** The study aims to identify galaxy candidates at redshifts z≥9 using the initial COSMOS-Web JWST observations. The goal is to determine the properties of these galaxies, such as redshift, UV-magnitudes, rest-frame UV slopes, and stellar masses, to gain insights into their nature and comparison with other galaxies at similar redshifts.

**Methods: ** The authors identified 15 galaxy candidates through observations over 77 arcmin^2 using four NIRCam filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, F444W) with an overlap with MIRI (F770W) of 8.7 arcmin^2. They applied several publicly-available Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting and photometric redshift codes to fit the sample and determine their characteristics.

**Results: ** The galaxy candidates were found to have redshifts between z=9.3 and z=10.9, UV-magnitudes between MUV = −21.2 and −19.5, and rest-frame UV slopes (⟨β⟩=−2.4). These galaxies were more luminous than most z≥9 candidates discovered by JWST to date but exhibited similar blue colors in their rest-frame UV. Stellar masses were derived in the range of ⟨log10(M⋆/M⊙)⟩≈8−9, and the volume density aligned well with previous values at z∼9−10. The sample of galaxies was found to be significantly resolved, although compact.

**Conclusions: ** The identification of these galaxy candidates contributes to our understanding of galaxies at extremely high redshifts. The derived properties, including the blue color, are consistent with models suggesting an underlying stellar population not yet fully enriched in metals. The findings are not in tension with the standard ΛCDM model, providing further insight into the characteristics and formation of early galaxies in the universe.

#### SFACT：A new emission line object searching project

[[2308.00826\] The Star Formation Across Cosmic Time (SFACT) Survey. I. Survey Description and Early Results from a New Narrow-Band Emission-Line Galaxy Survey (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00826)

**Aims: ** The study introduces the Star Formation Across Cosmic Time (SFACT) survey, a new narrow-band survey to detect emission-line galaxies (ELGs) and QSOs. The goal is to understand the properties of star-forming galaxies and AGNs as a function of redshift, and to explore these properties up to z = 1 and beyond.

**Methods: ** The survey is conducted using the wide-field imager on the WIYN 3.5 m telescope with three custom narrow-band filters centered on 6590 A, 6950 A, and 7460 A. Due to the superior depth and excellent image quality of the WIYN, ELGs can be detected to r = 25.0. The paper also presents follow-up spectra for some ELG candidates.

**Results: ** Initial results from the survey's three pilot-study fields have yielded a total of 533 ELG candidates in an area of 1.50 square degrees, corresponding to a surface density of 355 ELGs per square degree. The principal lines detected in SFACT are H-alpha (with redshifts up to 0.144), [O III]5007 (redshifts up to 0.500), and [O II]3727 (redshifts up to 1.015).

**Conclusions: ** The SFACT survey demonstrates success in identifying ELGs and providing information on their properties over a wide range of redshifts. The survey's unique approach of detecting ELGs in discrete redshift windows allows robust quantification of star-forming and AGN populations up to significant redshifts. The planned acquisition of additional narrow-band filters is expected to enable the expansion of the survey to substantially higher redshifts, further enhancing our understanding of star formation across cosmic time.

[[2308.01292\] The Star Formation Across Cosmic Time (SFACT) Survey. II. The First Catalog from a New Narrow-Band Survey for Emission-Line Objects (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01292)

**Aims: ** This particular paper focuses on presenting the first list of SFACT candidates obtained from their pilot-study fields.

**Methods: ** The survey utilizes the WIYN 3.5m telescope to achieve excellent image quality and depth, routinely detecting ELGs to r = 25.0. Targeting three primary emission lines (H-alpha, [O III]5007, and [O II]3727), the survey detects objects at redshifts z ~ 0-1.

**Results: ** From the coverage of 1.50 square degrees in the three pilot-study fields, a total of 533 SFACT candidates have been detected (355 candidates per square degree). The limiting line flux of the survey is approximately 1.0 x 10^16 erg/s/cm^2, allowing the detailed observation of faint ELGs.

**Conclusions: ** The paper demonstrates the successful implementation of the SFACT survey to detect faint emission-line galaxies and QSOs over a broad redshift range. The presented results from the pilot study fields showcase the survey's effectiveness in identifying and characterizing ELG candidates, providing valuable insights and details that will likely contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of star formation across cosmic time.

[[2308.01297\] The Star Formation Across Cosmic Time (SFACT) Survey. III. Spectroscopy of the Initial Catalog of Emission-Line Objects (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01297)

**Aims: ** This paper continues to discuss the Star Formation Across Cosmic Time (SFACT) survey, focusing on the detection of emission-line galaxies (ELGs) and quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) over a variety of redshifts. Specifically, it aims to present the spectroscopic data of 453 objects from the three SFACT pilot-study fields, detail the methodology for processing and measuring the data, and distinguish between star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs).

**Methods: ** The survey makes use of the WIYN 3.5m telescope and the Hydra multifiber positioner to perform efficient follow-up spectroscopy on identified galaxies. 

**Results: ** The study identifies and analyzes 453 objects, with 415 confirmed as ELGs. Example spectra are displayed for the three primary emission lines used in the detection process, and the redshift distribution of the pilot-study sample is examined. The ELGs are further classified and placed in different emission-line diagnostic diagrams to differentiate between star-forming galaxies and AGNs.

**Conclusions: ** The paper illustrates the effectiveness of the SFACT survey's methodology in detecting and analyzing ELGs and QSOs. The careful spectroscopic examination allows for a nuanced understanding of these objects, including the ability to distinguish star-forming galaxies from AGNs.

[[2308.01476\] Physically motivated modeling of LyC escape fraction during reionization (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01476)

**Aims: ** The study focuses on an analysis of the Lyman continuum (LyC) escape fraction in galaxies, employing a physically motivated model. It applies this analysis to galaxies of the Illustris TNG50 simulation in a redshift range of z*=5.2−20

**Methods: **The study leverages the Illustris TNG50 simulation to model galaxies within a specified redshift range. By associating LyC escape to specific physical properties (such as metallicity and mass), two distinct modes of escape are identified. The authors further develop an analytical fitting formula, considering stellar and gas mass and redshift, to determine the escape fraction.

**Results: ** The analysis reveals a bimodal nature of LyC escape, linked to either: (a) high metallicity, low mass galaxies exhibiting extended star formation (ext-mode), where photons escape primarily from the galactic disk's outer regions, or (b) low metallicity, moderately massive galaxies with localized LyC escape from small central regions of high star formation (loc-mode). The ext-mode becomes prominent in small galaxies at later cosmic times, whereas the loc-mode is present across all redshifts in the study.

**Conclusions: **The paper uncovers a complex and bimodal nature of LyC escape in galaxies, categorized into two distinct modes, each related to specific physical properties.

[[2308.03745\] UNCOVER: Illuminating the Early Universe -- JWST/NIRSpec Confirmation of $z > 12$ Galaxies (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03745)

**Aims: ** The study presents the spectroscopic confirmation of the high-z galaxies candidates selected using the Lyman break methods.

**Methods: **

- **Imaging and Spectroscopy:** Galaxies were first discovered using JWST/NIRCam imaging. The distances of these galaxies were later deduced using JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy.
- **Stellar Population Modeling:** Detailed modeling using JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec data was carried out to ascertain the characteristics of the observed galaxies.

**Results: **

- **Discoveries:** Two galaxies were observed: one was confidently detected at z*=12.40 and another possible candidate was found at *z*=13.08.
- **Characteristics:** Through detailed modeling, the galaxies were found to have the following traits: Low mass, youthful age, rapid formation, metal scarcity, actively forming stars.

- **Physical Dimensions:** Both galaxies were spatially resolved with lensing-corrected rest-UV effective radii ranging between 300 and 400 pc, which is larger than other systems observed at similar or higher redshifts.

**Conclusion: **

Observations made in the Abell 2744 galaxy cluster field have highlighted some of the earliest galaxies, enriching our understanding of early galaxy formation. The size of these galaxies, in particular, challenges our current understanding, hinting at potential variations in the size-mass relationship during the universe's nascent stages.

[[2308.02750\] UNCOVER: The growth of the first massive black holes from JWST/NIRSpec -- spectroscopic confirmation of an X-ray luminous AGN at z=10.1 (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02750)

**Aims: ** The authors aims to confirm the presence and characteristics of the supermassive black hole (BH), UHZ-1. This black hole hosts in a galaxy, whose z_phot is very high.

**Methods: ** The NIRSpec/Prism spectrum was acquired and analyzed to ascertain characteristics typical of recently discovered z~10 galaxies. In addition, The auhtors carried out a fit to the spectrum and existing photometry to derive a stellar mass estimate for the host galaxy.

**Results: ** The spectroscopic confirmation of UHZ-1 placed it at a redshift of $z = 10.073 \pm 0.002$. The spectrum is primarily characterized by star-formation features and shows no clear evidence of the powerful X-ray source in the rest-frame UV/optical spectrum. This absence hints at heavy obscuration of the central BH.

**Conclusion: ** UHZ-1, an X-ray luminous supermassive BH at an exceptionally high redshift, offers insights into the early stages of BH formation and growth. The absence of the X-ray source in the UV/optical spectrum may indicate a Compton-thick column density, implying heavy obscuration. The derived stellar mass of the host galaxy, when juxtaposed with the BH mass, showcases a ratio that's much higher than local values. This supports the notion of the "heavy seeding channel" being a crucial factor in the formation of supermassive BHs within the first billion years of cosmic evolution.

[[2308.05735\] A supermassive black hole in the early universe growing in the shadows (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05735)

**Aims: ** The study present the spectroscopic confirmation of a lensed red-point sources. This newly identified population of red sources believed to signify a phase of actively growing supermassive black holes.

**Methods: **Deep spectroscopic observations were executed on the selected object, Abell2744-QSO1, to verify its nature, redshift, and other intrinsic properties.

**Results: ** 

- **Triply-Imaged Object:** The spectroscopic data confirmed that the three images were of the same object, namely a heavily reddened (AV∼3) broad emission-line Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN).
- **Redshift:** The object resides at a redshift of **z_spec = 7.0451 \pm 0.0005**
- **Black hole mass: ** The mass of the black hole was calculated to be $M_BH \sim 10^{7} \rm{M_{\odot}}$
- **Black Hole to Galaxy Mass Ratio:** The ratio was found to be unusually high, at a minimum of 3% and possibly up to 100%, which contrasts with the typical ratios found in nearby galaxies.
- **Properties Indicating Rapid Growth:** The absence of strong metal lines combined with its high bolometric luminosity suggests that the black hole is in a phase of swift growth, accruing mass at around 30% of its Eddington limit.
- **Population Estimate:** Based on preliminary JWST imaging, these types of heavily reddened, low-mass black holes might be about 100 times more prevalent than those typically chosen based on UV light during this time.

**Conclusion: **The unique properties and rapid growth observed for A2744-QSO1, particularly its high black hole to galaxy mass ratio, suggest that it might offer insights into the intermediate phase between initial black hole seeds and the earliest luminous quasars.

[[2308.06317\] A fast-rotator post-starburst galaxy quenched by supermassive black-hole feedback at z=3 (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06317)

**Aims: ** The most massive galaxies in the Universe appear to have halted star formation, possibly due to the influence of central super-massive black holes (SMBHs). Despite evidence for quenching, the exact mechanism remains uncertain. This is largely because local massive galaxies underwent this process billions of years ago.

**Methods: ** The study present the observations of GS-10578, a massive post-starburst galaxies at $z = 3.064$ made using the JWST/NIRSpec in its integral-field spectroscopy mode.

**Results:** 

- **Galaxy's Characteristics:** 
  - **Mass**:  stellar mass, $M^{*} = 1.6 \pm 0.2 \times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$; Dynamical Mass, $M_{dyn} = 2.0 \pm 0.5 \times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$.
  - **Star-formation**: Half of its stellar mass was formed at $z = 3.7-4.6$, current star-formation rate: SFR < 9 $M_{\odot}/yr$
- **Outflows in the galaxy:**
  - Both ionized and neutral gas outflows are detected, which are traced by [OIII] emission and NaI absorption.
  - The velocity of these outflows reaches approximately 1,000 km/s, which is too high to be solely attributed to star formation.
  - The presence of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in GS-10578 suggests that these outflows could be a consequence of SMBH feedback.

- **Stellar Kinematics:**  The galaxy showcases ordered rotation and is rotation-supported, as indicated by a spin parameter $\lambda_{Re} = 0.62 \pm 0.07$

**Conclusion: **

The observations of GS-10578 provide tangible evidence for ejective AGN feedback in a massive, recently quenched galaxy.

[[2308.08540\] First spectroscopic observations of the galaxies that reionized the Universe (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08540)

**Aims: **

- Understand the role of high-redshift, low-mass galaxies in cosmic reionization between redshifts of z=9 and z=6.
- Investigate the properties and significance of ultra-faint galaxies during the epoch of reionization, especially given uncertainties surrounding their photometric redshifts and their contributions to ionizing photon production and escape fraction.

**Methods: ** Using ultra-deep NIRSpec observation, the authors presents the analysis of 8 ultra-faint galaxies ($\rm M_{UV} \sim -17\ to -15\ mag$) from epoch of reionization in the cluster filed Abell 2744.

**Results: **

- **Mass: ** Detected some galaxies with incredibly low stellar masses, down to $7.6^{+1.7}_{-1.4} \times 10^5{\rm M_{\odot}}$, which are comparable to local group dwarf galaxies.
- **Metallicity: ** The metallicities of these galaxies are extremely low, down to 1%-6% $\rm Z_{\odot}$.
- **Ionizing efficiency: ** Found that these faint galaxies have an ionizing efficiency significantly higher than canonical values.

**Conclusion: **

- The ionizing photon output produced by these faint galaxies is substantial enough to surpass the reionization threshold, even with conservative estimates of escape fractions.
- These findings solidify the notion that faint galaxies were the predominant contributors to cosmic reionization at around z∼7.
