Tags: #JWST

- 研究利用了JWST/NIRISS对一个星系团场内的emission line galaxies光谱中的巴尔末线系进行了测量，得到了线强的空间分布。进而利用线强的空间分布得到了尘埃消光的分布。
- 文章先将这些emission-line galaxies进行了红移分bin，然后在每个红移bin中依据星系的质量进行分bin，然后再进行叠加，得到了按质量分类的尘埃分布
- 文章发现，小质量星系的尘埃消光相对较小，并且尘埃消光分布主要集中在星系中央，边缘衰减，而大质量组的星系尘埃消光的分布则较为均匀。
- 文章的意义：了解星系的结构形成需要了解星系的恒星形成，这主要通过观测星系SFR的空间分布来得到。为了得到星系的SFR空间分布，需要得到SFR探针的空间分布（如巴尔默先系），但是这些发射线容易被尘埃影响，因此同时还需要得到尘埃的分布。

- 利用ALMA观测[O III] & [C II]气体追踪高红移星系中的气体动力学，研究的样本主要是红移5处的star- forming galaxies。研究内容是高红移星系是否能够在红移5处形成冷气体盘，其中[O III]和[C II]分别用于追踪冷气体和温气体
- 研究发现气体弥散随着红移增长而增大，同本地星系相比高4～5倍，这符合高红移的气体更加turbulent，其中温气体比冷气体更加turbulent。在高红移处，大质量星系与尘埃贫的小星系气体动力学也不同。另外与理论的比较发现，气体的动能主要来自于盘内部的势能释放而非恒星形成反馈。

[[2304.01378] A Diverse Population of z ~ 2 ULIRGs Revealed by JWST Imaging (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01378)

- Use the JWST CEERS image to study the morphology of 4 ULIRGs selected by the PAH emission using Spitzer data. The mass of these four galaxies is $\sim 10^{11}$. Besides this, the properties of these galaxies varies widely. Hence more investments and large sample of ULIRGs are needed to study the nature of these galaxies.

- The authors studied 11 LAEs $3<z<6$ to study the relation of the Lyman Alpha photon escape and other galaxies properties. The author hopes to use the Lyman alpha escape fraction to estimate the LyC escape fraction, due to the condition allowing for the escape of Ly$\alpha$ photons could also allows for escape of LyC photons.
- **Ly$\alpha$ properties**: All sources are found to has extended Ly$\alpha$ emission, beyond the stellar regions, 3/11 sources has the double-peaked Ly$\alpha$ emission line. The authors also found that there is a correction between the Ly$\alpha$ line FWHM between the Ly$\alpha$ red peak velocity.
- **LyC properties**: They used three indirected indictor proposed by Masica et al .2023, and the estimated is low.
- **Galaxies properties** : They found that these galaxies are broadly consistent with low-z galaxies with Lyman alpha emitters in terms of Ly$\alpha$ EW, O23, $Ly$$\alpha$/H$\alpha$. Besides, the low-mass, compact size, high SFR features discovered by authors agree with the results of radiative transform simulations, implying that LAEs is at early stages of lifecycle.

However, a large sample is needed to make strong statement.

#RST #EOR 

- The void probability function is used to describe the clustering of galaxies, in terms of no-detection of LAEs in the given volume. The VPF could probes different ionization scenarios of reionization epoch.
- This paper used large simulation to test surveys with different area could determine the history. 
	- A survey of 1 deg^2 would distinguish between very late and early reionization at 3 $\sigma$ level at $z \simeq 7$
	- A survey of 4 deg^4 can distinguish between late v.s. fast, and early v.s. late, reionization at $3 \sim 4 \sigma$ between $7<z<9$
	- A survey of 16^deg can yield a detailed history of the reionization of the IGM and its effect on Lyman-α Emitter clustering.
	- 
- This paper also present the model of reionization, which proposed by Finkelstein et al. 19,  Yung et al. 2020, Naidu et al. 2020. Here these study are summarize below:
	- In F19, the faintest galaxies collectively dominate ionizing emissivity, leading to a very early reionization history and a very smooth pace. They also take the AGN contribution into account at $z \sim 6$. 
	- Y20 is a semi-analytic model, that combine the dark matter halo formation history and the galaxies evolution history, leaving only the escape fraction as the free parameter.
	- N20 focusing ionizing photon escape fractions. The model ties the photon escape fractions to the stellar formation surface density. Their model implies that rare very massive and UV bright galaxies (‘oligarchs’) account for the vast majority of the reionization budget.

-  The authors used the JWST/NIRSpec and MUSE to probe the optical line and Ly$\alpha$ line respectively. The sample consist of 12 LAEs with faint MUV magnitude $-20 < M < -16$.
-  Combining the constrain made to UV bright LAEs, there are is positive correlation between MUV and $\Delta \rm{Ly} \alpha$, consistent with $\Delta \rm{Ly} \alpha$ depends on halo mass.
-  Majority of sources falling on a trend of increasing EW with decreasing $\Delta \rm{Ly} \alpha$.
- Correlation between the optical line dispersion and  $\Delta \rm{Ly} \alpha$
- $\Delta \rm{Ly} \alpha$ is driven by the the abundance and velocity of natural hydrogen clear to HII region, and the faint galaxies at EOR are preferentially attenuated. The detection of faint galaxies could use to probe large ionized bubbles.

1. The authors used the NIRSpec to observe the three LAEs observed by the Keck/MOSFIRE before. Used the nebular line diagnostics, they found the these LAEs were highly ionized and metal poo, which is consistent with the results obtained by other observations made by JWST.
2. They found there is large offset in line measurement and marginal difference in velocity shifts of one LAEs. The simplest interpretation is the Ly$\alpha$ line is more extended in the cross-dispersion profiles, implying the Ly$\alpha$ halo.
3. They calculated sizes of ionized bubbles of these LAEs. The one with the highest-ionization condition might be capable of ionizing its own bubble, while the other two do not appear to be capable of ionizing such a large region, which means more ionization photons required.
	1. z8_13573: Could be associated with overdensity region which could form a contagious and extended ionized region that is sufficiently large enough for the escape of Ly$\alpha$ photons
	2. z8_69492: this source could dominate the ionizing budget due to it's bright nature.
	3. z8_32350: Increasing the Ly$\alpha$ due to its merging activity

1. The paper presents 7 galaxies selected based on NIRCam images with photometric redshift > 8. 4 sources are confirmed with relative secure redshift. Among these four sources, the redshift of two sources is determined by emission line and that of two sources are determined by the continuum break feature, which is consistent with the high Ly$\alpha$ optical depth.
2. The SED analysis shows that two galaxies with relative bright luminosity and blue slope, one of which has a stellar mass of log$(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) \simeq 9.3$. 
3. The photometric redshift largely agrees with those value measured by spectroscopic redshift, however, the photometric redshift are slightly overestimated, indicating that the current templates do not fully describe the spectra.

- 本文章利用针对JWST/NIRSpec仪器进行了数据分析,并确定了之前文献中超高红移星系的候选体的红移, 一共确定了16个星系,其红移范围在$z_{spec} = 8.61-13.20$之间,同时排除了一个具有超大质量的污染源($z_{spec} = 4.91$).利用这批样本,加上之前文献报道的9个超高红移星系.这篇工作一共做了以下几件事情:
- **限制超高红移处的紫外光度函数**:估计得到的光度函数和之前基于测光红移样本得到的光度函数相类似. 研究没有发现UV光度函数在超高红移处有剧烈演化的趋势,与某些星系的快速形成理论不符合
- **限制宇宙恒星形成历史**:本篇文章估计得到了宇宙恒星形成历史的最低下限,并且发现$z \sim 12$处的恒星形成历史相比于常恒星形成效率有一定的超出
- **限制星系的形成与演化**:排除了一个低红移污染源后, 作者们发现尽管此批超高红移星系没有出现违背$\Lambda$CMD宇宙学模型的超大恒星质量,但是很多星系的恒星质量均偏高, 他们的研究支持高恒星形成效率/潜在的AGN活动/top-heavy mass function,但样本内部有较大的scattering.

[[2304.08511] JWST/NIRSpec Measurements of Extremely Low Metallicities in High Equivalent Width Lyman-$α$ Emitters (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08511)

- The authors conduct a IR spectroscopic observation of 45 high EW LAEs, which only could be detected in the MUSE. These galaxies are ultra-faint galaxies ($L \sim 0.01 L_{\odot}$) at $z = 2.9-6.7$ with strong Ly$\alpha$ emission. They also conduct the observations of low EW LAEs. The observations of JWST covers the optical band of these sources (H$\alpha$, [OIII], H$\beta$, [N II]).
- The observations shows that these galaxies have lower metallicity compared to those with low EW. This implies the narrowband selection method is an efficient method to select the young, and less chemically enriched system.

Tags: JWST

- The authors used JWST/NIRSpec to observe 66 low mass galaxies at $3<z<10$ in the GOODS-S Deep field.
- They studied scaling relation between the metallicity, stellar mass, star-forming rate.  They found a evidence supports that the mass-metallicity has a shallower slope at low-mass end, which agrees with the MZR relation found at local analog of high-z galaxies (e.g. Green Pea & Blueberry).
- The inferred slope is well matched with the result predicted by model including the SNe winds, suggesting that the feedback mechanism in dwarf galaxies might be different from those in place at higher mass.

- 作者们发现,如果一个间接条件能够较好的预测LyC那么需要满足以下几点: 
	- 能够较好的追踪较高的specific star formation rata;
	- 对星系内的年轻星族敏感(3.5 Myr - 10Myr)
	- 能够较好的示踪ISM内的气体成分和气体密度
	O32, $\Sigma_{SFR}$, $M_{UV}$, $H \beta$等值宽度仅仅能满足以上一个或者更少条件,因此它们对$f_{esc}$的示踪性较差; 而$\beta$, $E(B-V)$能够满足两个以上的条件,因此它们对$f_{esc}$较好.同时,他们基于模拟建立了$f_{esc}$与O32, $\Sigma_{SFR}$, $M_{UV}$, $H \beta$, $\beta$, $E(B-V)$的关系,然后运用在红移6的LAEs上,发现大部分星系均有$f_{esc}<10\%$

Tags:  #JWST

- The paper presents a JWST cycle one observation program (ASPIRE). This is a program that conduct the imaging and spectroscopic survey of 25 QSO at EOR using NIRCam WFSS mode. 
- In this paper, they report a over-density structure (Filamentary Structure) traced by a QSO and 10 [OII] emitters at $z \sim 6$, which is one of largest over density structure known at early Universe and could eventually evolve into a massive galaxy cluster.
- The combination of the additional MUSE, AMLA and JWST observations indicts that the environment traced by this QSO is complex, where both UV-bright galaxies and dusty galaxies are present. This means that the evolution of galaxies around QSO is not carried out simultaneous.
- They also report 31 [O III] emitters at other redshift, with half of them resides in two galaxy over densities at $z = 5.4$ and $z = 6.2$. The discovery of two galaxy over densities in just one field indicates that high-$z$ [O III] emitters is a strong clustered population.

Tags: #JWST

- The papers conduct a searching of LBG in three QSO field, and the author find there are two overdensities in two QSO fields. One field shows a volume density 10x higher than the black-field UV luminosity and with tentative evidence of a 3 sigma over density within 500 ckpc from the QSO. Another field shows a angular over density within 500 ckpc from QSO but within 3sigma of prediction of UVLF.

- The paper also find that overdensities are not accompanied by an enhanced number of dusty galaxies, suggesting that the overdense quasar fields are not in the bursty star-forming phase sometimes seen in high-z protoclusters.
