[[2307.06994\] Size - Stellar Mass Relation and Morphology of Quiescent Galaxies at $z\geq3$ in Public $JWST$ Fields (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06994)

**Aims: **This study aims to systematically investigate the rest-frame optical morphology of quiescent galaxies at redshifts greater than or equal to 3.

**Methods:** The research was based on a sample of 26 quiescent galaxies selected by UVJ color or NUVUV J color, with a range of 9.8 < log (M⋆/M⊙) < 11.4 and 2.8 < zphot < 4.6. The size is constrained by fitting the Sersic profile.

**Results:**

1. **Rest-frame wavelength - size**:  The authors see a negative correlation between the observed wavelength and the size in our sample and derive their size at the rest-frame 0.5 µm taking into account this trend.
2. **5000A size - stellar mass:** Our quiescent galaxies show a significant correlation at $z>3$
3. **Size - redshift:** The results showed that the size-stellar mass relations were lower than those at lower redshifts
4. **Morphological transmission:**Moreover, the galaxies in the sample mainly consisted of bulge-like structures, as inferred from their median Sersic index and axis ratio. However, an increasing trend of galaxies with low Sersic index was noted, suggesting the possible onset of morphological transformation during 3 < z < 5.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that the size of quiescent galaxies increases monotonically from redshifts around 3 to 5. The findings also suggest that the epoch of morphological transformation might occur during 3 < z < 5, with an increasing fraction of quiescent galaxies exhibiting more disky characteristics.

[[2307.07535\] EPOCHS VII: Discovery of high redshift ($6.5 < z < 12$) AGN candidates in JWST ERO and PEARLS data (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07535)

**Aims:** The authors aims to study a sample of high redshift galaxies selected from the PEARLS and Early Release Observations data of JWST. The aims of this study is to search the AGN hosted in these galaxies and constrain their physical properties.

**Methods:** The authors used a threefold selection procedure to identify sources from parent sample:

1. SED fitting to identify the sources best fitted by AGN SED templates.
2. A secondary selection based on the relative performance of AGN and non-AGN models
3. The morphological fitting to identify compact sources of emission

They also looked at the emission from their sample sources from fields that overlap with Chandra and VLA surveys.

**Results:** This process resulted in the identification of nine AGN candidates at redshifts between 6.5 and 12. From this sample, they estimated a lower bound on the AGN fraction in this redshift range of 5±1%.  The rest-frame UV colors of these candidate objects suggest they might be obese black hole galaxies (OBGs), or AGN with very minimal galaxy components. A notable finding is a candidate source at a redshift of 11.9 that exhibited a sudden morphological shift in the reddest band compared to the bluer bands, potentially indicating a merger or an unusually strong outflow.

**Conclusion: **The study concludes that AGN may be quite common in the early epochs, as suggested by the lower limit set on their fraction in the examined redshift range. Some of these high-redshift AGN may be obese black hole galaxies, indicating AGN with little galaxy component. 

[[2307.07599\] JWST/CEERS Sheds Light on Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies: Forming Bulges, Lopsidedness and Outside-In Quenching at Cosmic Noon (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07599)

**Aims: ** The primary goal of this research is to explore the morphology and physical properties of 22 infrared-selected dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at Cosmic Noon (z ~ 2). The team aims to provide deeper insights into the spatial structures and active regions of star formation within these galaxies, along with the overall impact of their physical evolution over time.

**Methods:** The study uses deep imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope's Near Infrared Camera (JWST NIRCam) obtained from the Early Release Science survey in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) field. Each galaxy was divided into several uniformly colored regions based on red-green-blue images derived from the F115W, F200W, and F444W filters.  The Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) for each region was then modeled to measure various properties, such as dust attenuation, stellar masses, star formation rates, and ages. The researchers classified each region as either star-forming or quiescent, which led to further categorization of the galaxies based on the location of active star formation.

**Results: **The analysis revealed several key findings: (i) About 70% of the DSFGs have a compact, highly dust-attenuated star-forming core that is surrounded by a larger, less attenuated massive disk; (ii) A significant portion of the disks are lopsided, likely due to asymmetric cold gas accretion, major mergers, or large-scale instabilities; (iii) 23% of the galaxies have a star-forming core embedded in a quiescent disk, suggesting outside-in quenching facilitated by strong lopsidedness; (iv) Some galaxies host highly heterogeneous disks in terms of RGB colors due to inhomogeneous dust attenuation; (v) There is evidence of clump-like substructures being quiescent or located in quiescent regions.

**Conclusion:**The findings demonstrate that the JWST/NIRCam provides an invaluable tool for understanding the complex evolution of distant massive galaxies. The varying locations and levels of star formation, the presence of lopsided disks, and the discovery of quiescent clump-like substructures all provide key insights into the intricate processes of galactic evolution and star formation.

[[2307.08633\] JADES: deep spectroscopy of a low-mass galaxy at redshift 2.3 quenched by environment (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08633)

**Aims: ** The authors reported the discovery of a quiescent galaxy at $z=2.34$ with a stellar mass of only $M~10^8 M_{\odot}$. This is the least massive quiescent galaxy found so far at high redshift

**Methods:** We use a Bayesian approach to model the spectrum and photometry.

**Results: **The researchers found that the target galaxy has been quiescent for 0.6 Gyr and has a mass-weighted average stellar age of 0.8-1.7 Gyr. The galaxy displays an inverse color gradient with radius, consistent with environment-driven quenching. An identified overdensity in the galaxy's vicinity contains three spectroscopically confirmed, massive, old galaxies. The target galaxy lies only 35 pkpc away from the most massive galaxy in this overdensity, which is located close to the overdensity's center.

**Conclusion:**The findings suggest that the quiescent state of the low-mass galaxy was likely induced by its environment, providing potentially the earliest evidence for environment-driven quenching to date.

[[2307.08633\] JADES: deep spectroscopy of a low-mass galaxy at redshift 2.3 quenched by environment (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08633)

**Aims: **The authors used the drop-outs technique to select high-z galaxies based on JADES data. The aim is to measure and analyze the UV slope of these galaxies.

**Methods:** The UV slope is determined using the SED fitting. In addition, the authors also construct a control sample of galaxies at $z \simeq 5-9$ to conduct a comparison of galaxies at two different redshifts.

**Results: ** The authors compare the properties of two sample of galaxies, and they found that

1.  The median UV slope of $\beta = -2.4$, and by comparing to the sample of $z \simeq 5-9$, finding a shift toward bluer rest-UV colors at all $M_{UV}$
2. The most UV-luminous $z > 9$ galaxies are significantly bluer than their lower-redshift counterparts, representing a dearth of moderately-red galaxies within the first 500 Myr. Also the galaxies at $z>11$ galaxy population exhibits very blue slopes, implying a very low dust attenuation.
3. A robust sample of 44 galaxies with $\beta < -2.8$ is identified, which have SEDs requiring models of density-bounded HII regions and median ionizing photon escape fractions of 0.51 to reproduce. Their rest-optical colors imply that this sample has weaker emission lines than typical galaxies. consistent with the inferred escape fractions.
4. This sample consists of relatively low stellar masses , and specific star-formation rates  nearly twice that of our full galaxy sample, suggesting these objects are more common among systems experiencing a recent upturn in star formation.

**Conclusion:** We demonstrate that the shutoff of star formation provides an alternative solution for modelling of extremely blue UV colors, making distinct predictions for the rest-optical emission of these galaxies. Future spectroscopy will be required to distinguish between these physical pictures.

[[2307.09503\] CEERS Key Paper VII: Emission Line Ratios from NIRSpec and NIRCam Wide-Field Slitless Spectroscopy at z>2 (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09503)

**Aims：** The authors aims to check the evolution of specific emission lines across different redshifts, as well as their relationship with the stellar mass and star formation rate.

**Methods: ** The paper used the JWST/NIRCam and JWST/NIRSpec to obtain the spectra of 155 galaxies. These galaxies were then compared to lower redshift sample from the SDSS and CLEAR surveys. The authors measured the Ha, [OIII]/Hb, and [NeIII]/[OII] emission lines. They also correlated these emission line ratios with Hb star formation rate and stellar mass. Finally, they compared the observations with MAPPINGS V models and Illustrious TNG predictions.

**Results: **

1. The study found a significant correlation between [OIII]/Hb with redshift and a marginal correlation between [NeIII]/[OII] and redshift.  These trends were found to be consistent with the MAPPINGS V models, indicating lower metallicity and higher ionization in low-mass and high-SFR galaxies. 
2. The IllustriousTNG predictions accurately depicted the highest [OIII]/Hb ratios observed in the sample, without the need for significant shock ionization components.

**Conclusion: ** The study reveals crucial correlations between specific emission line ratios, stellar mass, SFR, and redshift in high redshift galaxies. These results agree with both the MAPPINGS V models and the IllustriousTNG predictions, suggesting that such models can effectively describe the ionization and metallicity properties of distant galaxies

[[2307.09590\] The FENIKS Survey: Spectroscopic Confirmation of Massive Quiescent Galaxies at z ~ 3-5 (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09590)

**Aims: ** The authors aims to expand the quiescent galaxies sample at z > 3.5, while the number of spectroscopic confirmations of quiescent galaxies at z<3 has increased over the years, there are only a handful at z>3.5. 

**Methods: ** First they selected the candidates from the FENIKS survey, which uses deep Gemini/Flamingos 2Kb, Kr imging optimized for increased sensitivity to the characteristic red colors of galaxies at z>3 with strong Balmer/4000 Å breaks. Then they uses 11 hours of Keck/MOSFIRE K-band observations.

**Results: ** 

1.  The rest-frame UVJ and (ugi)s colors of 3/4 quiescent candidates are consistent with 1−2 Gyr old stellar populations. This places these galaxies as the oldest objects at these redshifts, and challenges the notion that quiescent galaxies at z>3 are all recently-quenched, "post-starburst'' galaxies.
2. Our spectroscopy shows that the other quiescent-galaxy candidate is a broad-line AGN (z=3.594) with strong, redshifted Hβ+[O III] emission with a velocity offset >1000 km/s, indicative of a powerful outflow
3. The star-formation history of our highest redshift candidate suggests that its progenitor was already in place by z∼7−11, reaching ∼ 1011M⊙ by z≃10.

**Conclusion: ** These observations reveal the limit of what is possible with deep near-infrared photometry and targeted spectroscopy from the ground and demonstrate that secure spectroscopic confirmation of quiescent galaxies at z>4 is only feasible with JWST.

[[2307.10363\] JWST's PEARLS: Mothra, a new kaiju star at z=2.091 extremely magnified by MACS0416, and implications for dark matter models (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10363)

**Aims: ** The authors reported a discovery of Mothra, an extremely magnified star in one of the strongly lensed galaxies behind the galaxy cluster MACS0416.

**Methods: **The authors utilized observations made with the HST and JWST to identify and study the "Mothra" system.  They also examined the implications of the lensing perturber, considering its constraints on the cold dark matter model, warm dark matter models, and axion dark matter models.

**Results: ** "Mothra" is situated in a galaxy with a spectroscopic redshift of z=2.091 and has been detectable for at least eight years, indicating the presence of a small lensing perturber. Microlenses alone cannot explain the observations, and a larger perturber with a mass of at least 104 solar masses provides a more satisfactory explanation. The maximum mass of the perturber is less than 2.5×106 solar masses, making it the smallest substructure constrained by lensing above redshift 0.3.

**Conclusion: ** The existence of this small substructure is in line with expectations from the standard cold dark matter model. However, the presence of such a small substructure in a cluster environment presents implications for other dark matter models. Warm dark matter models with particle masses below 8.7 keV are ruled out by the observations, while axion dark matter models are only consistent if the axion mass falls within a specific range. This research provides valuable data in understanding the role of dark matter in the structure of the universe.

**Aims: **The authors construct the Lyman-alpha emitters at $2.05 < z < 3.75$, estimated from a sample of 67 LAEs candidates in the miniJPAS and J-NEP survey. These two surveys cover a total effective area of ∼ 1.14 deg2 with 54 Narrow Band (NB) filters (FWHM ∼ 145 Å) across the optical range, with typical limiting magnitudes of ∼ 23

**Methods:** The authors develop a method for detecting Ly-alpha emission for the estimation of the Ly-alpha LF using the whole J-PAS filter set. To test the selection method they used and to compute the correction needed while constructing the LF, they build a mock catalog, which represents the typical LAE populations at $1.9<z<4.5$ and contains the expected contaminants (low-z galaixes and z<2 QSOs).

**Results: ** The authors could provide the Lyman-alpha LF at the intermediate-bright range of luminosity combining these surveys. The photometric information provided by these surveys suggests that our samples are dominated by bright, Lyα-emitting AGN. They fit the LF using both power law and Schechter function.

**Conclusions: ** Overall, our results confirm the presence of an AGN component at the bright-end of the Lyα LF. In particular, we find no significant contribution of star-forming LAEs to the Lyα LF at log10(LLyα/erg s−1 ) > 43.5. This work serves as a proof-of-concept for the results that can be obtained with the upcoming data releases of the J-PAS survey.

**Aims: ** The main aim of this study is to create the first spatially resolved maps of gas-phase metallicity for dust-obscured star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at a redshift of about 4. These galaxies are observed as part of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) TEMPLATES Early Release Science program. The researchers aim to understand the level of metal enrichment in these galaxies and how it correlates with their high star-formation rates and gas-to-dust ratios.

**Methods: **The authors use the JWST's Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) integral field unit spectroscopy to measure the Hα and [NII] emission lines, which allow them to infer the metallicity of the galaxies. They also utilize the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to obtain rest-frame 380μm continuum and [CI](https://chat.openai.com/c/3P2-3P1) line maps to study the variations in metallicity and gas-to-dust ratios across these galaxies.

**Results: **The study finds that the two galaxies investigated are highly metal-rich, with indications of regions showing supersolar metallicity. These regions have likely undergone significant enrichment due to their high star-formation rates. They also find that the metallicity and gas-to-dust ratios are anticorrelated at highly resolved spatial scales, a finding that is consistent with previous studies of galaxies at redshift 0.

**Conclusion:** The data are indicative of the enormous potential of JWST to probe the enrichment of the interstellar medium on ∼kpc scales in extremely dust-obscured systems at z ∼ 4 and beyond.

[[2307.11818\] Identifying Lyα emitter candidates with Random Forest: learning from galaxies in CANDELS survey (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11818)

**Aims: ** The authors aim to understand the correlations between the strength of the Lyman Alpha (Lyα) emission line and various physical and morphological properties of galaxies. They also aim to develop a new method to identify galaxies with the highest probability of being Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) using a machine learning classifier.

**Methods: ** : The authors investigate a sample of 1578 galaxies in the redshift range 2 ≤ z ≤ 7.9 from the GOODS-S, UDS, and COSMOS fields. They analyze the correlations between the Lyα equivalent width and several galaxy properties like stellar mass, star formation rate, dust reddening, metallicity, age, half-light semi-major axis, Sérsic index, and projected axis ratio. The authors then develop a Random Forest-based machine learning classifier to select galaxies that are most likely to be LAEs.

**Results: ** The authors find that LAEs are typically common main sequence star-forming galaxies which show stellar mass ≤ 109 M⊙, star formation rate ≤ 100.5 M⊙/yr, E(B − V) ≤ 0.2, and half-light semi-major axis ≤ 1kpc. The machine learning classifier they developed demonstrates an 80 ± 2% accuracy and 73 ± 4% precision for galaxies in the redshift range z ∈ [2.5, 4.5]. At higher redshifts (z ∈ [4.5, 6]), they report a 73% accuracy and 80% precision.

**Conclusion: ** The authors conclude that it's possible to overcome the current limitations in assembling large samples of LAEs by making informed predictions using machine learning. This approach can be utilized for planning future large-scale spectroscopic surveys, thereby advancing our understanding of LAEs.

**Aims：** The authors aims to explain how the gas rejected is recycled by the galaxy, which is important to understand how the galaxies acquire material from the circumgalactic medium.

**Methods: ** The authors used the Keck Cosmic Web Imager integral field unit to observe a type-II QSOs at $z = 2.65$. By fitting the spectra, they investigate both the column density and velocity.

**Results: **

1. By investigating the spatial distribution of emission, they revealed diffuse emission of the Ly-alpha, He II 1640, and C IV 1549 on the projected physical scale of 122 kpc, 45 kpc, 79 kpc. The total luminosity of Ly-alpha is ~ 10^42 erg/s. The line ratio diagnostics are consistent with the photoionization including recombination and photon punmping.
2.  By fitting the spectra, we derive both the column density and the velocity. We find that the velocity profile from both the absorption and the He ii emission exhibit increasing trends. Moreover, both the line ratio diagnostic from the emission and the column density ratio from the absorption confirm that the cool gas metallicity is ≥ Z⊙.

**Conclusion: ** From detailed modeling and estimation, gas recycling might be a more plausible interpretation compared with the scenario of a powerful outflow

[[2307.14414\] First rest-frame infrared spectrum of a z>7 quasar: JWST/MRS observations of J1120+0641 (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14414)

**Aims: ** The authors used the JWST to observe a high-z redshift QSO. The JWST could probe the rest-frame optical-infrared spectrum of the high-z QSO. This could help the community understand the origin of first supermassive black holes.

**Methods: ** This is the first spectroscopic observation of a reionization-era quasar in the rest-frame infrared wavelengths (0.6 < lambda < 3.4 micron). The observations enable for the first time the detection of hot torus dust, the Hα emission line, and the Paschen-series broad emission lines in a quasar at z > 7.

**Results: **

1. Hot torus dust is clearly detected as an upturn in the continuum emission at λrest ≃ 1.3µm, leading to a black-body temperature of Tdust ~ 1413.5 
2. We measure the black hole mass of J1120+0641 based on the Hα Balmer line, MBH = 1.52 ± 0.17 · 109M⊙, which is in good agreement with the previous rest-UV Mg II black hole mass measurement.  The black hole mass based on the Paschen-series lines is also consistent within uncertainties, indicating that no significant extinction is biasing the MBH measurement obtained from the rest-frame UV
3. By comparing the ratios of the Hα, Pa-α and Pa-β emission lines to predictions from a simple one-phase Cloudy model, we find that the hydrogen broad lines are consistent with originating in a common broad-line region (BLR)

**Conclusion:**  Overall, we find that both J1120+0641’s hot dust torus and hydrogen BLR properties show no significant peculiarity when compared to luminous quasars down to z = 0. The quasar accretion structures must have therefore assembled very quickly, as they appear fully ‘mature’ less than 760 million years after the Big Bang

[[2307.15113\] Elentári: A $z\sim3.3$ Proto-Supercluster in COSMOS (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15113)

**Aims:** The study aims to explore potential structures related to three overdense regions that have been spectroscopically confirmed in the COSMOS field at redshift 𝑧 ∼ 3.35. The goal is to understand the characteristics of these structures, their density, mass, and their potential to virialize.

**Methods:**  The authors use the Voronoi tessellation Monte Carlo method to construct a three-dimensional density map to identify additional areas of significant overdensity. They also employ deep multi-wavelength photometry and extensive spectroscopy available for the field.

**Results:** The authors identify a set of six overdense structures at 3.20 < 𝑧 < 3.45 in the COSMOS field. The most well-characterized structure, PCl J0959+0235, has 80 spectroscopically confirmed members and an estimated mass of 1.35 × 1015 M⊙. It is projected to virialize at 𝑧 ∼ 1.5 − 2.0. These structures contain ten overdense peaks with > 5𝜎 overdensity, which suggests that they might be part of a proto-supercluster similar to the Hyperion system at 𝑧 ∼ 2.45.

**Conclusion:** The authors suggest that the identified structures could be part of a proto-supercluster. Further photometric surveys with JWST (like COSMOS-Web) and additional spectroscopic follow-ups will enable a deeper analysis of these structures and help to understand the effects that such an environment may have on its component galaxies at these early times.

**Aims:** The authors aim to select intrinsically faint Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) and Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) and to study the interrelation of these two populations, their properties, and the fraction of LBGs that display Lyman-alpha emission.

**Methods: ** The researchers used data from four galaxy clusters in the Lensed Lyman-alpha MUSE Arcs Sample (LLAMAS), along with deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry, to select a population of intrinsically faint Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) and Lyman-alpha Emitters (LAEs). The study identifies the largest collected sample for the aims I mentioned, consisting of 263 LAEs and 972 LBGs, between redshifts of 2.9 and 6.7.

**Results: ** The authors find a redshift evolution of the Lyman-alpha emitter fraction in line with past results, suggesting an increasingly neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) above z=6. Interestingly, the Lyman-alpha emitter fraction for the UV-brighter half of the sample is higher than the fraction for the UV-fainter half, a difference which increases at higher redshifts.

**Conclusions: ** The authors interpret their surprising result as indicating a population of low Lyman-alpha EW, UV-bright galaxies situated in reionised bubbles. They also suggest that this finding is particularly interesting in the context of similar, UV-bright, low Lyman-alpha EW objects recently detected around the epoch of reionisation. Finally, the authors find that the strongest LAEs generally have fainter UV magnitudes and steeper UV slopes, a finding that extends previously observed trends to intrinsically fainter objects.
