# JWST Summer School—Day 2

- JWST targets near-infrared and mid-infrared 
  - Extinction is much lower than the optical band.
  - The glow of the hot dust

- Scientific questions:
  - How the stars and star cluster form

- Access to the details: 

???

### Stellar feedback

1. Matter cycle - regulated by the stellar feedback process
2. Stellar feedback = injection of energy/m/mass into the ISM
3. Size + Evolution: of the bubble
4. HII in Galaxy and Extragalactic galaxies
5. Impact of stellar feedback
   1. LF: low-luminosity end, SN
   2. Shape the galaxies shape
   3. Destroy PAH

6. 80 Galaxies at south sky: with alma+HST+JWST+MUSE and so on observations
   1. ALMA CO intensity maps, traces the molecular clouds
   2. HST NUV data, young star cluster?
   3. MUSE: Get spectrum at different position to traces the state of ISM
   4. JWST: Dust & PAH emission

7. How the feedback shape the structure?

   1. Molecular Gas <-offset-> star-formation, see the aligned regions
      1. Geometry <–> star at center

   2. Bubbles statistics of JWST
   3. Matching bubbles with ionizing sources
      1. Do the star power the tolxxx: SN+winds are needed.
      2.
