[[2305.19331]CEERS: MIRI deciphers the spatial distribution of dust-obscured star formation in galaxies at 0.1<z<2.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19331)

**Aims**: The main objective of this research is to measure the stellar and dust-obscured star formation distributions of a mass-complete (>$10^{10}$M⊙) sample of 95 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at 0.1<z<2.5. The researchers are particularly interested in determining rest-mid-infrared (rest-MIR) morphologies, and exploring any correlations between rest-optical and rest-MIR sizes and their dependence on stellar mass.

**Methods used**: This study combines HST images from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey with JWST images from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey. Rest-MIR morphologies are determined using sharpest Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) images dominated by dust emission. Sérisc indices are measured for the brightest MIRI sources, and for fainter sources, the index is fixed to unity. Rest-MIR sizes are compared to rest-optical sizes, and these comparisons are analyzed in relation to stellar mass and the galaxies' positions relative to the main sequence.

**Results**: Bright galaxies (S/N>75) show a median Sérisc index of 0.7, indicating a disk-like morphology in rest-MIR. Starburst galaxies (above the main sequence) have rest-MIR sizes that are about half their rest-optical sizes. The ratio of rest-optical to rest-MIR size in main sequence galaxies was found to increase with stellar mass. Interestingly, 15% of the SFGs studied had a compact star-forming component within a larger stellar structure.

**Conclusion**: The study finds a mass-dependent trend resembling the one found in literature between rest-optical and rest-near-infrared sizes of SFGs. This suggests that the trend is due to dust attenuation gradients affecting rest-optical sizes and that the sizes of the stellar and star-forming components of SFGs are generally consistent across all masses. A small population of SFGs with compact star-forming components embedded in larger stellar structures may represent an intermediate stage in galaxy evolution - a potential link between galaxies with extended and those with compact stellar components, possibly shedding light on the formation of so-called "blue nuggets.”

[[2306.00487]JWST Measurements of Neutral Hydrogen Fractions and Ionized Bubble Sizes at z=7−12 Obtained with Lyα Damping Wing Absorptions in 26 Bright Continuum Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00487)

**Aims**: The primary goal of this study is to present volume-averaged neutral hydrogen fractions (xH i) and ionized bubble radii (Rb) measured using Lyα damping wing absorptions of galaxies at the epoch of reionization.

**Methods used**: The study combines JWST/NIRSpec spectra taken by various programs to obtain data on 26 bright UV-continuum galaxies at redshifts between 7 and 12. The researchers construct four composite spectra binned by redshift, estimating Lyα damping wing absorption in these spectra with realistic templates. They base their assumptions on the standard inside-out reionization picture, which posits an ionized bubble with radius Rb around a galaxy in the inter-galactic medium of xH i.

**Results**: The authors note a clear evolution of spectral flattening towards high redshift, which suggests the increase of Lyα damping wing absorption. The xH i and Rb values obtained were seen to monotonically increase and decrease respectively across the examined redshifts. The study found that the redshift evolution of xH i suggests a moderately late reionization history, which is consistent with evidence from cosmic microwave background electron scattering and the evolution of the UV luminosity function.

**Conclusion**: The conclusion of this paper posits that their Rb measurements are about 20 times larger than the cosmic average values estimated by analytic calculations for a given xH i, and are comparable with values for merged ionized bubbles around bright galaxies predicted by recent numerical simulations. This research supports a moderately late reionization history with an escape fraction (fesc) of about 0.17.

[[2306.01644] HYPERION. Merger and outflow in the most luminous z>6 quasar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01644)

**Aims**: The study aims to observe and analyze the [CII] 158 μm emission line and the continuum at 253 GHz and 99 GHz towards SDSS J0100+2802 (a Quasar at redshift approximately 6.3), which is the most luminous QSO (Quasi-Stellar Object) at z>6, using ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) deep observations.

**Methods used**: The authors used deep observations from the ALMA telescope, at 2.2" resolution in band 3 and 0.9" resolution in band 6, optimized to detect extended emission around the QSO.

**Results**: The team detected a merging, tidally disrupted companion both in [CII] and in continuum, stretching on scales up to 20 kpc from the quasar, with a knotty morphology. They estimated the dust mass, star formation rate (SFR), and neutral gas mass of the newly-detected companion. They also detected a broad blueshifted component in the [CII] spectrum aligned with the radio jet of the QSO. The companion remained undetected by deep JWST imaging observations, demonstrating the efficacy of ALMA in detecting dust obscured sources.

**Conclusion**: The findings suggest that both the QSO and its companion are gas-rich, with boosted star formation possibly originating from major merging. The authors also propose that they may have detected a radio jet-driven outflow at such high redshift. The results underline the significance of deep medium-resolution ALMA observations for the study of QSOs and their environment during the Epoch of Reionization.

- **Aims**: The study aims to provide new detections of the [OIII]λ4363 auroral line in galaxies up to redshift z∼9.5, using data from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). It seeks to determine electron temperatures and oxygen abundances in these galaxies and to evaluate the effectiveness of locally calibrated strong-line diagnostics and recent high-z calibrations.
- **Methods**: The study leverages ultra-deep spectroscopic observations taken with the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the JWST. It applies the direct Te method to determine electron temperatures and oxygen abundances in the galaxies. The researchers compare these results with locally calibrated strong-line diagnostics and high-z calibrations. They also propose an alternative diagnostic based on a different combination of R3 and R2 ratios.
- **Results**: The authors report that the locally calibrated strong-line diagnostics and high-z calibrations fail to simultaneously match their sample of galaxies, indicating a need for revision. They find that the dependence between the R2 and O3O2 line ratios and metallicity is weak, suggesting these ratios are ineffective as metallicity diagnostics in the high-z universe. They also note a tentative flattening of the R3 and R23 ratios, indicating future difficulties when applying these ratios as metallicity indicators in the high-z universe.
- **Conclusions**: The paper concludes that the local and high-z calibrations for determining metallicity need to be revised for application in the high-z universe. They propose an alternative diagnostic and find a reasonably good agreement with the JWST sample at low metallicity. However, they also observe discrepancies between their sample and local galaxies in terms of ionization/excitation ratios and rest-frame equivalent widths (EWs) of Hβ, suggesting a need for deeper examination into the factors affecting the production of [OIII]λ4363 in the high-z universe.

[[2306.03916] Connecting the escape fraction of Lyman-alpha and Lyman-continuum photons in star-forming galaxies at **z**≃4−5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03916)

- **Aims**: The primary objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between the escape fraction of Lyman-alpha (Lyα) and Lyman-continuum (LyC) photons in a sample of 152 star-forming galaxies. This is an important aspect of understanding galaxy evolution and star formation processes. In particular, the study aims to explore the correlation between fLyαesc and fLyCesc for the first time at the redshift range of approximately 4-5.
- **Methods**: The researchers used a combination of measurements derived from broad-band photometry and Lyα equivalent width measurements from VANDELS spectra to estimate fLyαesc for each galaxy in the sample. They also used equivalent widths of low-ionization, Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) absorption lines in composite VANDELS spectra to derive estimates of fLyCesc.
- **Results**: The researchers found a positive correlation between Lyα equivalent width (Wλ(Lyα)) and fLyαesc, with fLyαesc increasing from about 0.04 at Wλ(Lyα)=10Å to about 0.1 at Wλ(Lyα)=25Å. They also discovered that fLyCesc rises monotonically with fLyαesc, in a relationship that approximates to fLyCesc being about 15% of fLyαesc.
- **Conclusion**: The study concludes that the correlation between fLyCesc and fLyαesc is consistent with theoretical predictions and is not driven by a secondary correlation between fLyαesc and Wλ(Lyα). These results suggest that future estimates of fLyCesc within the Epoch of Reionization should be based on indicators sensitive to neutral gas density/geometry and dust attenuation, which provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms governing photon escape in galaxies.

[[2306.04627] Inside the bubble: exploring the environments of reionisation-era Lyman-α emitting galaxies with JADES and FRESCO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04627)

- **Aims**: This study aims to examine the environments of 16 Lyman-α emitting galaxies (LAEs) in the reionization era (5.8 < z < 8) that were identified by the JWST/NIRSpec as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). The objective is to understand the nature of the ionized regions in which these galaxies are situated, as well as their relationship with large-scale galaxy overdensities.
- **Methods**: The researchers conducted a detailed analysis of the LAEs, including their Lyman-α velocity offsets and Lyman-α escape fractions. They used these data to estimate the sizes of the ionized regions, or "bubbles," within a patchy reionization scenario. They also considered the relationship between the LAEs and large-scale galaxy overdensities observed in the FRESCO survey at specific redshift ranges.
- **Results**: The study found that the LAEs in their sample are situated in ionized regions of the order of 0.1 pMpc to 1 pMpc. Approximately half of these LAEs were found to coincide with large-scale galaxy overdensities seen in the FRESCO survey. The LAEs, however, and their direct neighbours, which are generally UV-faint, were not able to produce the required ionized regions based on their Lyman-α transmission properties.
- **Conclusion**: The findings from this study indicate that lower-luminosity sources may play an essential role in carving out the ionized regions observed. The study underscores the importance of LAEs as tracers of the first large-scale ionized bubbles, and demonstrates the power of the JWST multi-object and slitless spectroscopy in providing a unique view of the early stages of Cosmic Reionization through the most distant LAEs.

[[2306.04536] JADES: The production and escape of ionizing photons from faint Lyman-alpha emitters in the epoch of reionization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04536)

- **Aims**: This study aims to examine the properties of 16 faint Lyman-α emitting galaxies (LAEs) at z > 5.8 as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field/GOODS-S. It intends to understand their physical and chemical composition, as well as the dynamics and evolution of these galaxies.

- **Methods**: The researchers used JADES spectroscopic data to identify the LAEs and measure their properties such as UV magnitude range, Lyman-α equivalent width, redshifts, and velocity offsets. They also explored other rest-optical emission lines to understand the properties of the stars and interstellar media within these galaxies. Various galaxy properties were used to predict Lyman continuum escape fractions for the LAEs.

- **Results**: The study found that the LAEs are consistent with metal-poor systems with high ionization parameters, akin to the general galaxy population at z > 6. An anti-correlation was observed between Lyα escape fraction and velocity offset from systemic. The strength and velocity offset of Lyα did not correlate with galaxy spectroscopic properties or with ξion. The researchers noted a decrease in Lyα escape fractions with redshift, indicative of decreasing sizes of ionized bubbles around LAEs at high redshifts.

- **Conclusion**: The study concludes that the ionizing photon output into the intergalactic medium from these LAEs remains roughly constant across the observed UV magnitude and Lyα equivalent width, with a slight increase with redshift. The correlations they derived between the ionizing photon output from LAEs and UV magnitude Lyα strengths and redshift can be used to develop realistic, observationally-driven reionization models.

[[2306.03931] JADES: Balmer Decrement Measurements at redshifts 4 < 𝒛 < 7](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03931.pdf)

- **Aims**: The study aims to explore Balmer decrement Hα/Hβ measurements for a sample of 51 galaxies at high redshifts (𝑧 = 4–7) as part of the JADES survey. The researchers seek to understand the correlation between Balmer decrement and stellar masses (𝑀★) at these high redshifts, indicating early build-up of dust in these galaxies.
- **Methods**: The study relies on JWST/NIRSpec MSA 28-hour long exposures and the efficiency of the prism/clear configuration, complemented by information from medium-resolution gratings. This method allows researchers to probe the low-mass end of the galaxy population, reaching stellar masses as low as 107 M⊙.
- **Results**: The researchers found that a correlation between Balmer decrement and 𝑀★ is already established at these high redshifts, indicating a rapid build-up of dust in moderately massive galaxies at such early epochs. The lowest-mass galaxies in their sample showed a low Balmer decrement, suggesting very little dust content. However, they note that this low Balmer decrement could also be due to an intrinsically lower Hα/Hβ, resulting from the extreme conditions of the ionized gas in these early and unevolved systems. A tentative correlation was also found between the Balmer decrement and the continuum-derived star-formation rates (SFR).
- **Conclusion**: The study concludes that the lowest-mass galaxies at high redshifts show a remarkably low Balmer decrement, suggesting a very minimal dust content. The correlation between Balmer decrement and stellar masses is established, indicating a rapid dust build-up in moderately massive galaxies at such high redshifts. However, more extensive sample sizes are necessary to distinguish between direct and primary correlations from indirect and secondary dependencies at these high redshifts.

[[2306.05295\] The Star-forming and Ionizing Properties of Dwarf z~6-9 Galaxies in JADES: Insights on Bursty Star Formation and Ionized Bubble Growth (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05295)

- **Aims**: The study aims to investigate the star-forming and ionizing properties of 756 z∼6−9 galaxies, focusing on hundreds of faint UV objects. The research seeks to better understand the galaxies driving reionization, particularly their ages, stellar masses, emission line equivalent widths (EWs), star formation histories, and Lyman continuum escape fraction. The researchers also analyze the photometric overdensities around two z>7 strong Lyα emitters.

- **Methods**: The researchers used deep nine-band NIRCam imaging data from JADES. This allowed them to study hundreds of very faint galaxies. They examined the equivalent widths (EWs) of the [OIII]+Hβ and Hα emission lines, made inferences about the metallicities and star formation histories of these galaxies, and analyzed the UV luminosity dependence.

- **Results:**

  1. The researchers found that the faintest galaxies in their sample typically had low stellar masses and young ages, though some showed strong Balmer breaks, implying older ages. 

  2. No evidence was found for extremely massive galaxies in the sample. 

  3. They observed a strong decline in the typical [OIII]+Hβ EWs towards very faint galaxies but a weak UV luminosity dependence on the Hα EWs.

  4. The data provided evidence that the brightest galaxies frequently experienced a recent strong upturn in SFR. 

  5. The study also indicated a possible correlation between MUV and Lyman continuum escape fraction.

- **Conclusions:**
  - The paper concludes that the observed trends in emission line EWs can be explained by lower metallicities and more recently-declining star formation histories in fainter galaxies. 
  - The potential correlation between MUV and Lyman continuum escape fraction, if confirmed, could have significant implications for understanding the contribution of galaxies along the luminosity function to cosmic reionization, underscoring the need for deep spectroscopic follow-up. 
  - The analysis of photometric overdensities around two strong Lyα emitters suggested that not all such emitters reside in large ionized bubbles.

[[2306.05448] Little Red Dots: an abundant population of faint AGN at  z∼5 revealed by the EIGER and FRESCO JWST surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05448)

- **Aims**: The aim of the study is to characterize the prevalence and properties of faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe. This will help understand the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their role in cosmic reionization.

- **Methods**: The researchers performed a spectroscopic search for broad Hα emitters at z≈4−6 using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging and wide field slitless spectroscopy from the EIGER and FRESCO surveys.

- **Results**: 
  1. The researchers identified 20 Hα lines at z=4.2−5.5 with broad components that they interpret as being powered by accretion onto SMBHs. 
  2. The implied masses of these SMBHs are in the range of ∼107−8 M⊙. In the UV luminosity range MUV = -21 to -18, they measured number densities of ≈10−5 cMpc−3, which is an order of magnitude higher than expected from extrapolating quasar UV luminosity functions. However, these AGN are found in less than 1% of star-forming galaxies at z∼5. 
  3. In two objects, they detected narrow red- and blue-shifted Hα absorption indicative of dense gas fueling SMBH growth and outflows.

- **Conclusions**: 
  1. The study concludes that early SMBH growth is highly obscured and that faint AGN are only minor contributors to cosmic reionization. 
  2. They uncovered a strong correlation between reddening and the fraction of total galaxy luminosity arising from faint AGN. 
  3. The researchers also suggest that they may be witnessing early AGN feedback that could clear dust-free pathways through which more massive blue quasars are seen.

[[2306.07320] UNCOVER: Candidate Red Active Galactic Nuclei at 3<z<7 with JWST and ALMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07320)

- **Aims: ** Using the JWST Cycle 1 Treasury program Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam Observations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) in the lensing field Abll 2744, the authors report the identification of a sample of red dots that likely host highly-reddened AGN.

- **Methods: ** Using a NIRCam only selection method, 26 objects are selected. The criteria they used is 1) NIRCam F444W < 27.7 mag; 2) F115W - F220W $\sim 0$, blue in rest-frame 3) F200W-F444W = 1-4; 4) dominated by a point-source like central component. Furthermore, 20 objects are covered by ALMA 1.2-mm coverage, yet no source is detected individually or in a stack.
- **Results:**
  1. For the majority of the sample, SED fits to the JWST+ALMA observations prefer models with hot dust rather than obscured star-formation.
  2. While the dusty compact star formation could not be ruled out, the combination of extremely small size, red rest-frame optical slopes, and hot dust could be explained by reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei.
  3. Our targets have faint M1450≈−14 to−18 mag but inferred bolometric luminosities of Lbol=1043−1046 erg/s, reflecting their obscured nature.

- **Conclusion:** 
  1. If these objects are confined as AGNs with upcoming UNCOVER spectroscopy, then we have found an abundant population of reddened luminous AGN, that are at least ten times more numerous than UV-luminous AGN at the same intrinsic bolometric luminosity.

[[2306.07940] Statistics for Galaxy Outflows at z∼6−9 with Imaging and Spectroscopic Signatures Identified with JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07940)

- **Aims: ** We present statistics of z ~6-9 galaxy outflows indicated by spatially-extended gas emission and broad lines. 

- **Methods:** 

  1. The author constructed the emission line image by the subtraction of NIRCam broadband images. Among 61 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at z $\sim $ 6-9, they find 5 galaxies with ionized gas emission extended beyond the stellar component. 
  2. They also investigate medium- and high-resolution NIRSpec spectra of 30 galaxies at z ~ 6-9,  and identify five galaxies with broad (140−800~km~s−1) lines in the Oiii forbidden line emission, suggestive of galaxy outflows.

- **Results:** One galaxies at z $\sim 6.38$ shows both the spatially-extended gas emission and the board lines. None of galaxies with the spatially-extended gas emission or broad line present a clear signature of AGN either in line diagnostics or broad lines.

  These show that the outflow is driven by the stellar feedback

- **Conclusion:** The existence of galaxies with/without spatially-extended gas emission or broad lines may suggest that these are galaxies in the early, late, post phases of galaxy outflows at high redshift.

[[2306.09142] GN-z11: The environment of an AGN at z=10.603](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09142)

- **Aims:** The study aims to investigate the characteristics of GN-z11, one of the most distant galaxies identified, by exploring the presence of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), indications of Population III (PopIII) stars in its halo, and a detection of Lyα despite the expected largely neutral inter-galactic medium at such a redshift
- **Methods:** The researchers used recent JWST/NIRSpec Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations to demonstrate that the Lyα emission in GN-z11 is part of an extended halo.  They also used deep imaging from the JWST/NIRCam to investigate potential emission line candidates within the IFU Field-of-View.
- **Results:** 
  - The team detected high-ionization lines, CII*1335 emission, and an ionization cone in GN-z11, indicating the presence of an AGN. 
  - They also found that GN-z11 lies in a large-scale, overdense structure with potential signs of PopIII stars in its halo.
  - Lyα emission was detected as part of an extended halo with a minimum size of 0.8-3.2 kpc. Three other emission line candidates were identified within the IFU Field-of-View.

- **Conclusion:** 
  - The paper concludes that GN-z11 hosts an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), and it lies in a large-scale, overdense structure with possible signatures of PopIII stars in its halo.
  - They also suggest that the Lyα emission in GN-z11 is part of an extended halo. If the additional emission line candidates are confirmed, it could indicate that the local region of GN-z11 represents a candidate protocluster core, forming just 400 Myr after the Big Bang.
